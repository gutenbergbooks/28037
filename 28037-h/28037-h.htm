<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>A QUESTION OF SKILL</h3>
</div>

<p>
It was June, and the peaceful stillness of a
summer&#8217;s day hung over an ancient wood
which lay in the heart of the New Forest
near the village of Lyndhurst. The wood
was a part of a large demesne which had at
one time been bordered by hedges of yew and
holly, but these, having been untrimmed for
years, had grown into great bushes which in
many places were choked up by underwood
and brambles.
</p>
<p>
The forest stretched in every direction.
Wood after wood rose before the eye, masses
of color, the birches hung with softest green,
the oak boughs breaking into amber and
olive made doubly bright by the dark gloom
of the firs. Wide-branched oaks were intermingled
with beeches and copsewood of various
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
descriptions so closely in some places as
to intercept the sunshine. In others the trees
receded from each other, forming wide vistas
that gave glimpses of other recesses of sylvan
solitude.
</p>
<p>
Down the long sunlit glades the gold belted
bees sounded their humming horns through
every flowery town of the weald. Gauze-winged
dragon-flies darted hither and thither
while butterflies of every hue sailed by on
wings of sheeny bronze. In the bracken
wild roses rioted in the richest profusion; the
foxglove blazed like pillars of fire through
the shadowy underwood and the woodbine
flaunted its tall head proudly among the
leaves. A gentle breeze rustled the fern, and
breathed upon the quaking grass, setting its
beautiful spikelets in motion until they
seemed like fairy bells rung by elfin fingers.
The flutter and hum of the wild things
served but to intensify the stillness of the
wood.
</p>
<p>
All at once the deep bass notes of a hound
broke upon the air. Louder and louder grew
the baying, and soon from out of the purplish
shade of the trees there dashed a large
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
greyhound followed by a laughing, panting
maiden.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Content thee, Echo,&#8221; she cried flinging
herself upon the sward under a wide-spreading
oak. &#8220;I have breath to follow thee no
more. Rest until our good cousin joins us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The dog obediently stretched himself by
her side, and once more quiet reigned in the
wold. Presently the maiden sat up with an
impatient movement.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;He tarries long,&#8221; she said throwing a
mass of auburn curls from a broad, low brow.
&#8220;Marry! I fear that we have done but an ill
turn to the good Hugh.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
As she spoke the form of an elderly man
emerged from the trees and approached her
slowly. He was withered and thin and
though but fifty years of age seemed much
older. His doublet and hose were of some
dark stuff and his short cloak was surmounted
by a huge ruff, the edges of which almost
joined the brim of the small, high, cone-shaped
hat which partly concealed his gray
hair.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;By the mass, Francis! methinks that
thou dost grow more unmannerly each day.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
Thou art as unthinking as the butterfly, else
thou wouldst not have burdened my fore-wearied
flesh with thy bow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;In sooth, it was but a poor return for thy
kindness to leave thee my bow,&#8221; observed the
girl as she hastened to relieve him of the
crossbow that he held. &#8220;Thy pardon, Master
Hugh. I was intent upon the race and
thought not of it. It was a good dash, I
promise you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Ay! I make no doubt of it,&#8221; grumbled
the old man seating himself. &#8220;But &#8217;twere
meeter for a maiden to embroider, or to play
the virginals than to shoot the bow or run
with the hounds as thou dost.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Said I not my Latin well this morning,
cousin?&#8221; queried Francis. &#8220;Doth not my
lady mother instruct me in the tent and cross-stitch
each day? Besides doth not even the
Queen&#8217;s Majesty disport herself with the bow?
&#8217;Tis the fashion, good my master.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Ay! &#8216;Dum vitant stulti vitia, in contraria
currunt,&#8217;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_A" id="FNanchor_A"></a><a href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> spoke the old man sharply.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Be not angry, cousin, I did but ill in running
from thee.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Marry! let it pass, but I mislike such
sturdiness, Francis. Thou hast led me a
sorry chase and we are far from the Hall. If
I mistake not, we are even now in Sanborne
Park and that, thou knowest, is trespass.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay, cousin; not unless we kill some of
the red deer with which it abounds, and that
we have not done&mdash;yet,&#8221; spoke the maiden
demurely.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;The thought of such a thing should not
be entertained by the daughter of Lord William
Stafford. Thou durst not think it,
Francis.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Durst not?&#8221; laughed Francis teasingly.
&#8220;Should one stray in our path I will show
thee what I durst.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Boast not, girl. It bespeaks ill for thy
breeding. Thou art too prone to vaunt thy
skill in shooting. Not so was that flower of
womanhood, the Lady Jane Grey. Once,&#8221;
and the tutor spoke warmly for this was a
favorite theme, &#8220;once it was my good hap to
pass some time at Broadgate, her father&#8217;s seat
in Leicestershire, and never have I seen her
like for love of learning. Greek, Latin,
French and Italian spoke she as well as her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
own tongue. Some knowledge had she also
of Hebrew, Chaldee and Arabic. She loved
not such idle sport as the chase. Would that
thou wert like her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Out upon thee for so evil a wish,&#8221; chided
Francis, but there was a merry twinkle in her
eye that softened the harshness of her tone.
&#8220;Wouldst have me beheaded? Yet it may
be that I am such a dullard that thou dost
wish that I should meet with a like fate.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay, child! Thou knowest better.&#8221; The
face of the old man softened involuntarily as
he gazed into the laughing countenance of
the girl before him.
</p>
<p>
Her head was crowned by a mass of red
gold hair which, guiltless of crisping or curling
pins, fell in ringlets over her shoulders;
her complexion was of creamy fairness; her
features regular, her eyes dark and luminous;
her whole expression full of winsomeness;
but there was a sparkle in the dark eyes now
so full of mischief, and a set to the rich red
lips that spoke volumes for the spirit of Mistress
Francis Stafford.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I would only that thy desire for learning
was like to that of the Lady Jane&#8217;s,&#8221; went on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
the tutor. &#8220;Yet I do not dislike thy courage,
and thou art a good wench, surely.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Hark!&#8221; cried Francis springing to her
feet. &#8220;I hear the hounds. Look ware,
Echo! Look ware! Ware, ware!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The greyhound, answering with short
sharp yelps, rushed forward frantically, and
then stood at gaze as a tall red deer bounded
from the covert into the open glade. The
noble animal&#8217;s strength was almost spent.
His mouth was embossed with foam and large
round tears were dropping from his eyes.
With a motion that was at once despairing
and majestic he turned to face his pursuers as
a pack of hounds dashed from the trees and
surrounded him, making the air hideous with
their clamor.
</p>
<p>
Instantly the maiden fitted a shaft to her
bow and let fly a bolt as the tutor uttered a
shrill cry of remonstrance:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Stay thy hand, girl! Knowest thou not
the danger?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Before the wounded animal could turn to
charge this new assailant an answering twang
sounded from among the trees and a second
arrow, sent with unerring precision, imbedded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
itself in the deer&#8217;s body. As the stag fell, a
lad of some sixteen years, clad in the dress of
a forester, ran hastily forward and reached the
animal at the same moment that Francis did.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Behold, cousin,&#8221; cried the girl triumphantly,
&#8220;I have slain the deer. Could thy
Lady Jane Grey have done so well, thinkest
thou?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay, fair maid,&#8221; and the boy turned
quickly, &#8220;&#8217;twas mine own bolt that did the
deed. Behold for thyself that thy shaft struck
too far to the left.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;&#8217;Tis false,&#8221; cried Francis angrily. &#8220;&#8217;Twas
mine arrow that slew him. This one is mine,
and thou seest that it alone hath entered the
vital part. &#8217;Tis thine that is too far to the
left.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay; not mine, but thine,&#8221; retorted the
lad. &#8220;What? Would I, who lack but little
of man&#8217;s estate be excelled by a girl? See for
thyself, mistress. The two are not an inch
apart. The point is only which did the deed.
On mine honor, I tell thee, that it was mine
own arrow. Thou seest that it hath penetrated
deeper than thine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I see naught of the kind,&#8221; answered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
Francis with passion. &#8220;It was mine that
did it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Good master,&#8221; said the boy appealing to
the tutor, &#8220;didst mark that the stag fell not
until he received my shot?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Ay! I noted it, lad, and &#8217;tis a point well
taken,&#8221; quoth Master Hugh. &#8220;But a truce to
thy quibbling. Here are the huntsmen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The noise of the horns had been growing
louder and louder as the hunting party drew
near, but the boy and girl were so absorbed in
their controversy that they had not heeded
it.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Fair maiden, there is a penalty,&#8221; began
the lad, but one of the hunters called out:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Beshrew me! if the quarry be not slain!
What varlet hath done this?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
As Francis started forward the lad spoke,
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I, good my master. Give me thy knife,
I pray thee, that I may make the essay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;What, ho, boy? Thou? Then instead
of breaking the stag, thou shalt break the
jail. Knowest thou not that it is trespass to
kill deer upon the land of another?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;He did it not,&#8221; cried Francis. &#8220;&#8217;Twas I.
What is the penalty? My father, Lord William
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
Stafford, will requite the loss; but permit
me, I pray, to take trophy of my skill.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Thou?&#8221; The foresters who had surrounded
the youth looked with amusement at
the girl, and then broke into loud guffaws.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Heed her not, masters. Could a maiden
do such a thing? She knows not of what
she speaks.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay; give heed to me, I beseech you,&#8221;
cried Francis, but the lad interrupted her.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Permit it to be as I have said, mistress. If
there be penalty, &#8217;twere meeter for me to suffer
it than for thee. Withdraw, I beseech you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;The boy is right,&#8221; said Hugh Greville.
&#8220;It is no place for thee, Francis. I will speak
to thy father concerning the matter. Meantime
we can serve no good purpose here.
Come!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;No, no,&#8221; cried the girl trying vainly to
make the foresters attend her. &#8220;&#8217;Twas I who
killed the deer. It was not this lad.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
But the verderers paying no further attention
to her words busied themselves about the
cutting up of the deer. With a burst of
angry tears Francis reluctantly permitted the
tutor to lead her away.

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>THE SOLDIER GUEST</h3>
</div>

<p>
Passing out of the park, Francis and her
tutor came into the forest proper. One vast
sea of woods rolled, a flood of green, over hill
and valley onward and ever on till lost among
the moors. Presently they ascended Stoney
Cross Hill and there opened out one long
view. On the northeast rose the hills of
Winchester but the city was hidden in their
valley. To the east lay Southampton by the
waterside; and to the north, gleamed the
green Wiltshire downs lit up by the sunlight.
</p>
<p>
Among the beeches but a short distance
away lay Castle Malwood with its single
trench and Forest lodge, where tradition says
that William Rufus feasted before his death,
and down in the valley was the spot where he
is said to have fallen. The road now became
a long avenue of trees&mdash;beeches with their
smooth trunks, oaks growing in groups, with
here and there long lawns stretching far away
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
into distant woods. All at once the manor
burst upon the view.
</p>
<p>
Situated in the midst of a noble park which
crowned the summit of one of the hills that
fringed the borders of the weald, Stafford
Hall, in this year of grace 1586, the twenty-eighth
of Elizabeth, was graceful and stately
in the extreme. The general design of the
castle was a parallelogram defended by a
round tower at each of the angles with an
Anglo-Saxon keep. The entrance through a
vaulted passageway was its most striking feature.
Of the time of the first Edward, there
were signs of decay in tower and still more
ancient keep. Crevices bare of mortar gave
rare holding ground for moss and wall flower,
and ivy and clematis mantled chapel and turrets
with a dank shroud that added to the
picturesqueness of the building.
</p>
<p>
The park, full of ferny depths, glorious old
oaks and deep glades, stretched away on one
side toward the soft recesses of the forest.
On the other its wooded declivities sloped
down to an idle brook now stopped up by
water-lilies and white crowfoot. The fair
corn lands sloping to the southeast so as to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
miss no gleam of morning or noonday sun;
the fat meadows where the herbage hid the
hocks of the browsing kine, and the hanging
woods holding so many oaks and beeches ripe
for the felling, formed an appanage that was
almost royal.
</p>
<p>
The views of the castle, the winding declivity
of hill, the trees, the fields, the exquisite
landscape in the distance made an assemblage
of nature&#8217;s beauties that was at once inspiring
and noble.
</p>
<p>
But Francis Stafford was too angry to heed
either beauty of scene or sky, and she hurried
toward the Hall with so quick a step that the
tutor could scarcely keep pace with her.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I cry you mercy, Francis,&#8221; he panted
querulously as the girl paused reluctantly in
answer to his pleading. &#8220;Age hath stolen my
vigor and I cannot walk as thou canst. Already
thou hast made me plod many a weary
step beyond my strength; and now thou
wouldst have me run as though I were a lad.
Thou art too unheeding.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;A truce to thy chiding, cousin,&#8221; rebuked
the girl sharply. &#8220;I marvel that thou dost
appeal to my compassion. Thou knowest my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
skill with the bow, and thou didst see the
deer fall under my shaft; yet thou didst say
with the boy that &#8217;twas he who did the deed.
Catiff! How dared he claim the stag? And
&#8217;twas a hart royal!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Yet had he not done so thou wouldst have
had to suffer fine and imprisonment. Dost
know the law? It says&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I care not what it says,&#8221; declared Francis
haughtily. &#8220;If I offend against the law then
&#8217;twere meet that I should bear the penalty.
My father shall right the matter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Master Greville knowing full well the futility
of contradicting his charge when she was
in such a wilful mood said no more, but
meekly followed her as she started once more
on her way. Through the great doors, which
were of weathered oak thickly studded with
nails, over which hung the family coat of
arms, a shield, azure, three quatrefoils, argent,
the girl and the old man passed across the
paved courtyard, up a flight of steps to the
terrace which led to the porch and from
thence to the ante-hall passage.
</p>
<p>
Serving men clothed in blue with the family
arms upon the left sleeve, and retainers clothed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
also in blue but without the heraldic device
thronged courtyard, terrace and hall. Francis
hastened through the ante-hall passage to the
great hall which lay beyond. The floors were
freshly strewn with rushes, the walls were
hung with rich tapestries representing stories
from the classics. The upper end contained
an oriel window under which was a fringed
dais. On one side of the apartment was a
huge fireplace over which the ancestral arms
hung with the arms of England over them.
On the other side towered lofty windows. A
screen gallery, an organ and a high table completed
the hall which was the principal room
of the castle and the place where all of the
feasts, mummeries and masques were held.
</p>
<p>
Ushers were hurrying through the great
hall for it was &#8220;covering time,&#8221; and the
household was mustering for the midday
meal. Francis threaded her way through
the crowd of yeomen to the door of the presence
chamber, and drawing aside the arras
that hid the entrance, opened it and entered.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My father,&#8221; she began abruptly, and then
paused for she saw that her father was not
alone.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Is it you, my daughter?&#8221; Lord Stafford
rose to meet her. The resemblance between
them was very striking. &#8220;I had just asked
for you. This is my child, Fortescue. She
of whom we were speaking. Give greeting,
Francis, to my good friend Captain Fortescue.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Francis gave a quick glance at her father&#8217;s
guest. He was a man of commanding
stature, with black hair and keen black eyes
that held a cruel light in them. He was
arrayed in a blue velvet jerkin with hose of
the same material. A large beaver hat with
a long feather in it lay on the table. A
rapier depending from his belt completed his
attire which was that of a soldier. Without
heeding this fact something in his bearing
caused the girl to address him as a priest.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I give thee welcome, good father.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Said I not that the wench was shrewd?&#8221;
asked Lord Stafford with a hearty laugh.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Ay, my lord; and &#8217;twas well said,&#8221; returned
the guest. &#8220;My child, do you not see
that I am attired as a soldier?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I crave forbearance,&#8221; faltered Francis in
some confusion. &#8220;I did not notice thy dress,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
but judged from thy manner. Nathless, priest
or soldier, I give thee greeting. Prithee heed
not mine error.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;&#8217;Twas naught,&#8221; smiled Captain Fortescue.
&#8220;It is to my praise that thou didst accost
me as an holy man. My lord, methinks the
maid will serve our purpose well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I trow so,&#8221; answered Lord Stafford with a
proud look. &#8220;She hath spirit and courage to
a rare degree in a maid. I know no lad of
her age that can equal her in hunting or
hawking. No tercelet for her, but the fiercest
goshawk that e&#8217;er seized quarry. How now,
Francis?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My father, I knew that thou wouldst
believe my skill,&#8221; said Francis eagerly. &#8220;Yet
a lad did but now contend that he it was who
shot a deer in the forest,&#8221; and she related the
incident graphically.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Beshrew me, I doubt not but that thine
was the arrow that slew the buck, yet it contents
me well that the lad should endure the
penalty of the deed in thy stead. How now,
Greville?&#8221; to the tutor. &#8220;Was the youth
of noble birth?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Methought there seemed something of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
gentle in him, though he was but meanly
garbed. Yet the apparel doth not always
make the man,&#8221; answered Greville.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Not always,&#8221; acquiesced Lord Stafford.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;He was not noble,&#8221; interjected Francis
shortly. &#8220;Else he would not have claimed
the deer. I would, good my father, that you
compass his release, and let me take the consequences
of my action. I killed the deer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Be that as it may, child, the lad must
bear the penalty. There are matters of grave
import that must now be considered, and thou
canst aid me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I aid thee?&#8221; asked the girl in surprise.
&#8220;Father, didst thou say my aid?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Thine, child. Come to me anon, and I
will acquaint thee with the full import of the
matter. Greville, thou standest like a hind.
Give greeting to our guest. One would think
that thou hadst never been at court.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I give thee welcome, sir,&#8221; said Greville
bowing. &#8220;As my lord&#8217;s friend, I welcome
thee.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Methinks thy countenance is not unfamiliar,
Master Greville,&#8221; and the soldier
returned his obeisance courteously.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;In London mayhap thou hast seen me.
It was mine abode for a time,&#8221; replied the
tutor carelessly.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Perchance &#8217;twas there,&#8221; mused the other
with a searching look at the old man. &#8220;But
howsoe&#8217;er that may be, later will I pledge to
our better friendship.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I drink with no enemy of the queen,&#8221;
said Greville coldly.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Greville!&#8221; exclaimed Lord Stafford.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;We differ not, Master Greville,&#8221; smiled
the soldier. &#8220;My life, my service, my all
is devoted to our queen. God bless Her
Majesty!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;God bless Her Majesty, Elizabeth,&#8221; returned
Greville pointedly.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Thy mother waits thee, Francis, in her
tiring-room,&#8221; interposed Lord Stafford hastily.
&#8220;Come to me anon. Greville, no more of
this an thou lovest me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The tutor without another word withdrew
from the room accompanied by his pupil.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Was it not strange, cousin, that I should
have thought our guest a priest?&#8221; queried
Francis when they were beyond the portals
of the door.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay; the habit doth not always proclaim
the monk,&#8221; quoth Greville sententiously.
&#8220;You spoke truer than you knew when you
called him &#8216;father.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Is he in sooth then a priest?&#8221; asked the
girl curiously. &#8220;Why comes he then in such
array? Are not priests always welcome in my
father&#8217;s house?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Is it not within thy ken that an edict
hath been passed making it treason for priests
to be found within the kingdom, and felony
to harbor them? And, forsooth, there is
much reason for such a law. So many have
been the plots against the Queen&#8217;s Majesty
that much precaution must be taken to preserve
her from them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Would evil befall my father should it
come to the ears of the queen that he had
given a priest entertainment?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I make no doubt of it, child. Therefore
it behooves us to be silent respecting the matter.
But, by my life, girl! we dally too long.
Away! and set a guard upon thy lips. If
thou canst carry so weighty a matter sub
silentio then will I deem thee better than the
most of thy sex.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>THE PAGE&#8217;S DRESS</h3>
</div>

<p>
The bower chamber of the Lady Penelope
Stafford was both large and lofty yet there
was nothing there of ponderous grandeur.
The walls were covered with soft arras embroidered
in bright coloring skilfully blended.
The rich furniture was designed for ease and
comfort rather than pomp and parade. The
chamber was lighted by a large window with
broad casements between the mullions, and
with flowing tracery above of arch and
quatrefoil.
</p>
<p>
On a low couch sat Lady Stafford swinging
gently to and fro a delicate gold handled fan
of flamingo feathers which ever and anon she
laid aside to direct Francis who sat on a low
stool at her feet plying some embroidery
work.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;So, my daughter,&#8221; said the lady indicating
a cross-stitch. &#8220;Take heed to thy
work else thou wilt not excel with the needle.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
Marry, I marvel that thou dost accomplish
anything with such unskilful fingers. Knowest
thou not that the Queen&#8217;s Majesty did
fashion a shirt of cambric for her brother
when she was but six years old? I trow that
that is more than thou couldst do now; and
thou art more than double that age.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I crave thy forbearance, my sweet mother,&#8221;
pleaded Francis. &#8220;My fancy dwells not upon
my task, but the rather do I wonder in what
manner I may be of service to my father.
Dost thou know, my mother?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I could make a shrewd hazard as to its
nature, Francis. Content thee, child. Thou
wilt soon know all.&#8221; A look of anxiety
crossed the lady&#8217;s face as she spoke, which the
girl was quick to note.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Thou art troubled, my mother. Prithee
tell me the cause.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay, girl. Thy father will open up the
matter to thy ears when he deems it best.
Until then neither thou nor I may speak of
it. &#8217;Tis a woman&#8217;s lot to obey, and never to
question the decree of either father or husband.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;But why?&#8221; asked the maiden. &#8220;Have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
we not minds with which to reason? Can
we not think as well as men? Wherefore
then should we yield blind unreasoning
obedience when mind and soul are as noble
as theirs? Methinks that women&#8217;s judgments
are as wise as men&#8217;s.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Child, child,&#8221; exclaimed the lady startled
by the girl&#8217;s vehemence. &#8220;Thou hast too
much of thy sire in thee for a girl. I fear
such spirit. Study lowliness, for a woman
should be meek. Stifle whatever of questioning
may come into thy heart, and render
implicit obedience to thy father.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;That I will do, mother. Have I not ever
reverenced him? &#8217;Tis pleasure to obey his
will. The more because I have so much of
him in me. &#8217;Twas he who taught me how to
string a bow, and &#8217;twas he who guided my
maiden hand and eye until had I a brother
he could not excel in hunting or hawking.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I know, my daughter, yet my heart misgives
me because of these very things. Hadst
thou been a boy all this would not come
amiss. But thou art a girl, and full of the
weaknesses of women despite thy skill in
men&#8217;s sports. Nature, howsoe&#8217;er disguised,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
will soon or late assert herself. Thou art a
woman, therefore again I say, steep thy soul
in humility. I fear that haughtiness in thee
which thy father doth abet. Methinks it
bodes but ill both to thee and to him. But
this give ear to: in all things be submissive
to thy father. Heedst thou, Francis?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Yes, my mother.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I have thus spoken because dire forebodings
have seized me of late. Thy proud spirit
ill brooks authority, and thou wilt soon be of
an age when if thy will should clash with thy
father&#8217;s, I trow not the consequences. Therefore
have I counseled thee. But of this no
more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
For a time the two sat in silence, and then
Francis broke the quiet:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My mother, there is something that I
would fain <a name="quote" id="quote"></a><ins class="trnote" title="Transcriber&#8217;s Note: ending quote mark missing in original text">ask.&#8221;</ins>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Say on, my child.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;When I speak of it to Master Greville he
calls me disloyal, but I mean it not so. &#8217;Tis
only that I would know. My mother, why
doth Elizabeth reign as queen if our rightful
queen is Mary of Scotland? Dost thou believe
her to be the true heiress to the crown?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Yes, child; as what true adherent of the
faith doth not? Yet hath Elizabeth been a
good queen save and except that she hath
made severe laws against the exercise of our
religion. But England hath truly prospered
under her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;But there be some that would willingly
raise Mary to the throne, are there not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;&#8217;Tis treason to say so, but there be some
in very truth. &#8217;Tis because the queen fears
them that she hath kept Mary so long a
prisoner.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;How long hath it been, mother?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Near nineteen years. It is a long, long
time. She was full of youth and beauty
when she set foot upon English soil, but now
she hath grown old before her time with disease
and confinement. Truly the queen hath
dealt harshly with her own kin.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Master Greville saith that she is a cruel
bad woman, and that if she could compass
the death of our queen she would do so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Greville speaks of that of which he knows
naught,&#8221; said Lady Stafford sharply. &#8220;He
hath let the gossip of the court fill him to repletion.
It hath been said that Mary was a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
wicked woman, yet I believe it not. That she
desireth her liberty is no crime, but rather
the longing of all nature to be free. Mary is
the daughter and the granddaughter of a
king. Sometime queen of France, and
crowned queen of Scotland. She is cousin
german to Elizabeth, and if common natures
cannot brook confinement what wonder is it
that she sighs for freedom? This desire hath
caused her to attempt escape often by the aid
of friends, and given rise to the belief that
many would raise her to the throne.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Is Elizabeth beautiful, mother? Greville
says that she is the most lovely woman in the
world. That none can compare with her for
beauty, or for learning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Lady Stafford laughed and then checked
herself.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Child,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it is my prayer that
thou wilt grow here in thine own home as a
wild flower without sight of queen or court.
But if it should chance, which God forfend,
that thou art called to the court, then remember
what thy tutor hath told thee, and count
the queen the most beautiful of women.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;But is she?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;The queen is learned, child, beyond what
is usual for her sex. Greville will tell thee
that there never was her like for knowledge,
save and except the Lady Jane Grey, the which
would be treason to speak. I mind well
when Elizabeth was crowned that she was
fair to look upon, but that was twenty-eight
years ago. The queen is now past fifty years
of age. Doth a flower retain its loveliness
forever? I trow not. Yet methinks I do but
ill in speaking thus to thee. Elizabeth believes
that time for her hath stopped, and
that age but enhances those charms which
are the pride of women. Yet I have heard
otherwise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;You go not to court, my mother. Why?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Because of its troubles and its dangers,
Francis. Better to bide afar off in this remote
spot than to dwell among the jealousies
of courtiers. The favor of princes is uncertain,
and even royalty is not always well disposed
toward the happiness of a subject. I
would fain never behold the court again, and
I pray that thou mayst never be called to its
treacherous pleasures.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Art thou here, my child?&#8221; asked Lord
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
Stafford coming in at this moment. &#8220;This is
a favorable time, I ween, for me to unfold my
wishes to thee. Madam, will you bring the
page&#8217;s dress?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Lady Stafford arose and drew from a chest
of drawers the doublet, hose and short cloak
of a page.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Withdraw, Francis, to the tiring room,
and don these habiliments,&#8221; commanded her
father.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;But why,&#8221; began the girl, but Lord Stafford
waved his hand impatiently.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Do as I tell thee, girl. When thou art
habited, return and hear the reason for thy
strange attire.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Presently with a merry laugh Francis
bounded into the room, and, doffing the
jaunty bonnet that perched upon her tresses,
swept him a deep bow.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Am I not a fair boy, my lord?&#8221; she cried
gaily. &#8220;Do I not grace the garb?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;By my halidom, thou dost in very truth,&#8221;
exclaimed her father laughing. &#8220;But thy
tresses? Should they not be clipped?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay, good my lord,&#8221; spoke Lady Stafford
entreatingly. &#8220;Command not that, I pray
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
thee. Thou shalt see how cunningly my hand
can knot them up with silken strings. It will
not be amiss in a lad.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Leave them then, if thou wilt be the better
contented,&#8221; said the father. &#8220;And now,
child, if thou wilt but bring thy nimble wit
into the part, thou shalt please me well. How
say thee? Wilt thou bear me company upon
a grave mission? Will thy courage fail, or
canst thou, as if thou wert in very truth my
son, aid me to compass that to which I am
pledged? How now, girl? Hast courage for
such an undertaking?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My father, what mean you?&#8221; asked
Francis in bewilderment.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Take heed to my words. There is on foot
a movement to release from her vile durance
Mary, Queen of Scots. Too long hath she lain
imprisoned. I am to carry to her letters of
import that inform her of the design. But
Mary is so immured, that heretofore it hath
been impossible to gain access to her. A lad
would serve the purpose, but there be none
known to me of like courage and wit as thyself.
Girl, canst thou wear that garb and bear
thyself as a man?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Ay, my lord; and to do more if needful,&#8221;
spoke Francis boldly.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;There spoke myself in you,&#8221; said her
father approvingly. &#8220;Then hearken! at the
first sign of the dawn we set forth, thou and
I, for Chartley. How now, sweet chuck?&#8221; as
a sob escaped the mother. &#8220;Fear naught.
Thy birdling will return to thee the better for
having stretched her wings beyond the nest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I fear, my lord, for you both,&#8221; said the
lady brokenly. &#8220;You know how all these attempts
have ended, and Elizabeth hath no
mercy for the perpetrators of them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Now, now, be of good cheer. There is
naught of harm meant to the queen. &#8217;Tis
only to give Mary freedom. Think only of
thy daughter. Not many mothers in England
can boast of such a girl.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Would that I had given thee a daughter
of gentler spirit,&#8221; sobbed the lady. &#8220;Oh, my
lord, pardon my utterance. I fear, I fear&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;There! we will return safely and thou
wilt forget thy misgivings in the success of
our enterprise. But now to bed, to bed. The
first gray of the morning must find us on our
way. To bed, my child.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>ANTHONY BABINGTON</h3>
</div>

<p>
It was that darkest hour of the night, the
one just before the dawn, that Francis was
summoned to attend her father. None of the
household was stirring save Brooks, an old
servitor, who stood at the foot of the steps
with the horses. The statues of terrace and
court gleamed ghostly white in the darkness,
and the grim old keep frowned darkly upon
them. The deserted aspect of the courtyard
filled the girl with dismay. High purposes
and noble resolves flourish in the bright light
of day and grow into mightiness in the first
hours of the night, but the early dawn chills
enthusiasm and makes the inspirations of the
night before seem poor and weak and hardly
worth an effort.
</p>
<p>
Something of this feeling oppressed Francis
Stafford. She missed the shouting of the
gallants, the screaming of the hawks, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
yelping of the dogs and the blowing of horns
that was the accompaniment of a hunting-party.
Instead of such a triumphal departure
there was only the low sobbing of Lady Stafford
as she bade them farewell.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My lord, you will have great care for you
both, will you not?&#8221; she murmured, trying
to control her emotion. &#8220;Oh, I like not the
journey! I like it not!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Be not dismayed,&#8221; comforted her husband.
&#8220;We will return soon, and there is no danger.
We will be with thee again ere thou hast had
time to miss us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The lady said no more but embraced them
mournfully. Both father and child were silent
as they swept out of the courtyard into
the park beyond. Presently the sky began to
soften in the east, and the gray uncertain light
gave place to the blushing dawn. Soon the
dark shadows that lurked under the trees fled
before the golden beams of the sun. Suddenly
the note of a lark rang out silvery and
joyous. Bird after bird took up the note until
from every tree and shrub there swelled a
grand chorus as larks and throstles poured
forth their matin song of praise.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;How beautiful!&#8221; cried Francis, her eyes
sparkling, her spirits rising. &#8220;My father,
right glad am I to be here with thee.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Thine is a wild spirit, Francis,&#8221; said her
father rousing himself. &#8220;You mind me of
these birds, so wild and free yet sweet withal.
Child, mayhap I have done ill in taking thee
thus from thy mother. And yet, we are not
in the queen&#8217;s favor! Should misfortune
overtake one it would involve all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Father, if by act of mine I can further
thy purpose, make use of me, I pray. Glad
am I that thou dost deem me worthy of thy
confidence. And do we not go to the aid of
Mary, our rightful queen? What excuse
need we for so doing? Oh, if I can once
behold her, can but once kiss her hand, then
would I be willing to lose even my life if
&#8217;twere needful.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Lord Stafford smiled at her enthusiasm.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Has the infection seized upon thee too,
child? In like manner so do I feel, and so
do hundreds of others. Strange what an influence
Mary Stuart wields over human hearts!
God forfend that thy life should be required,
Francis, though many have been lost in her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
cause. But I would not that thine should be
numbered among them. Marry, it saddens
me to think on&#8217;t. No more of this!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;What name shall you call me by, my
father, since I am your page?&#8221; asked Francis
presently.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Thine own. &#8217;Tis a name that thou dost
wear because it was my father&#8217;s, and will serve.
But bear thyself in accordance with it and
none will deem thee other than thou seemest.
And I&mdash;I must teach my tongue to say boy
instead of child. We have a long ride before
us, and I fear that thy strength will fail ere
we reach its end.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Fear not, good my father. Thou knowest
how used to fatigue I am in hunting and
hawking.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I know thy strength, else I should have
feared to risk thee for so long a jaunt. And
thou hast never been so far from home before.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;No; I went with thee once to Lymington
where I saw The Solent, and in the distance
the Isle of Wight. But never have I been
even across Southampton water.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;True; I had forgot. Then thou wilt be
entertained greatly, for we go through Wilts,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
Gloucester and Worcester before we reach
Stafford.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
And so conversing on through the woods
they passed until at length they came to
Bramshaw, a little village standing partly
in Hampshire and partly in Wiltshire and
forming the forest boundary. Before them
swelled the rounded forms of the Wiltshire
downs, and from their midst towered the
spire of Salisbury with the mound of old
Sarum looming darkly behind.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I prithee tell me, father,&#8221; said Francis,
&#8220;what is that which I see in yon distance?
Methinks it looks like the tower of a church.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Its looks belie it not, Francis. It is the
spire of the cathedral of Saint Mary, than
which there is none higher in England. In
the valley lies Salisbury where we will stop
for rest and refreshment. Yon conical mound
is Old Sarum which hath been a fortress from
the earliest times. The fosse and rampart
belong to the Roman period. In the vast
plain which lies beneath it the Conqueror reviewed
his victorious armies, and there also
did the English landholders swear fealty to
him.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
</p>
<p>
Francis looked with the delight of one who
goes abroad for the first time. At the beautiful
cathedral, then at the old fort, and lastly
at the town itself which lay in the valley at
the confluence of four rivers: the upper Avon,
the Wiley, the Bourne and the Nadder. In
the centre of the city was a large handsome
square for the market-place from which the
streets branched off at right angles. The
streams flowed uncovered through the streets
which added greatly to the picturesqueness of
the place.
</p>
<p>
Lord Stafford turned into one of the side
streets, and drew rein before a small inn, The
Mermaid by name. As he rode into the courtyard
the host hurried forward to greet him.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Good my lord,&#8221; he said obsequiously,
&#8220;light, and grace my poor house, I pray you.
There be one here who hath waited since yester
e&#8217;en to see you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Beshrew me, sayst thou so!&#8221; ejaculated
Lord Stafford. &#8220;I thought not to meet with
any here. But oft must a man&#8217;s pleasuring be
staid for by affairs of business. Is it not true,
good Giles?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Marry, &#8217;tis only too true,&#8221; replied the host.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Where is he that would speak with me,
Giles?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;In the east parlor, my lord. I crave forbearance,
sir, for placing any in the room
which is reserved for your use, but I knew not
that you were about to fare this way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Trouble not thyself concerning the matter,
good Giles,&#8221; returned his lordship. &#8220;Come,
Francis.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Tossing his cloak to Francis he strode
toward the entrance of the tavern. The girl
threw the garment over her arm, started to
follow him, and then paused in sheerest confusion
at finding the eyes of the myrmidons
of the inn upon her.
</p>
<p>
Donning male attire in her own home had
been mere sport, but with the curious eyes of
strangers upon her the girl felt painfully embarrassed.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Look to thyself, boy,&#8221; came in sharp tones
from her father, and there was a note of warning
in the faint emphasis that he placed upon
the word boy.
</p>
<p>
Thus adjured Francis collected her wits,
and, looking neither to the right nor to the
left, she followed after her father with all the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
boldness which she could assume. Lord Stafford
wended his way to the east parlor of the
inn with the air of being perfectly familiar
with the place, giving his orders to the rotund
host as he went.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;&#8217;Tis but a short time that we will trouble
thee, Giles,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Serve us with dinner,
I pray you. We will rest for a time, and then
speed onward. Anthony,&#8221; he ejaculated as
the host threw open the door of the chamber,
&#8220;it is thou?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;&#8217;Tis even I, my lord,&#8221; answered a tall
young man coming forward. &#8220;I had news
that you were coming this way and hurried
hither to greet you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Right glad am I to see thee, Babington,&#8221;
was Stafford&#8217;s rejoinder. &#8220;I have much to
say to thee. Hast dined?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;No, my lord.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Then let us eat, and afterward there will
be leisure for converse. Be in haste with thy
meal, Giles.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The host hastened from the room while
Francis slipped quietly into the nearest chair,
and looked with interest at the young man.
She had heard of Anthony Babington. His
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
attachment to Mary of Scotland was well
known, and his devotion invested him with a
romantic glamour now that she too had
espoused the same cause. The young man
was speaking in low, rapid tones to her father:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I tell you, my lord, that the attempt will
not be successful. No invasion or insurrection
can occur during Elizabeth&#8217;s life, for
any open endeavor in Mary&#8217;s favor will cause
Sir Amyas Paulet to slay her. He hath sworn
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Then, Anthony, it may be unwise to try
to release Mary from her prison. She hath
suffered much of late from illness. It was my
hope that if we were successful, to place her
where she might obtain the comforts of which
she hath been bereft, and so placed she would
regain her health.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;The matter hath gone too far to end in
her mere release,&#8221; cried Babington earnestly.
&#8220;Elizabeth must die.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Babington, thou art mad!&#8221; exclaimed
Lord Stafford starting up in horror.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Mad? Nay; I have just begun to see
that I have been called to rid England of
that most unjust queen who transcends the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
laws of blood by keeping her own kin
imprisoned as she hath done. And I am not
alone, Stafford. There are others who believe
as I do. Wilt thou join us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Never,&#8221; cried Lord Stafford sternly.
&#8220;May my right hand drop from its shoulder
ere it be raised against England&#8217;s queen.
Unjust to Mary she hath been. Unjust in
her treatment of her, and unjust in usurping
the throne. But still she is her father&#8217;s
daughter, and crowned queen of England.
If it be so that the release of Mary can be
compassed, and Elizabeth forced to recognize
her as her successor, I will join the effort
even as I have already pledged to do. But
no more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Hast thou not seen Ballard?&#8221; asked the
young man in surprise.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Yes; he tarried with me at mine own
house as Captain Fortescue. How now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;He said that thou wert ripe for the project,&#8221;
mused the other.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Not to assassinate Elizabeth,&#8221; returned
Lord Stafford firmly. &#8220;I go to Chartley now
to acquaint Mary with the plan for her
release. But I tell thee, Anthony, if what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
thou tellest me be true, then will I withdraw
from the enterprise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My lord, I did but try thee. Some there
be who advocate the slaying of Elizabeth, but
they are few. I beseech you, as you have
given your pledge, aid us in acquainting
Mary with the plan for her rescue. No more
than this do we ask, and thou art depended
on for this much.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;As mine honor hath been given, I will
continue to Chartley,&#8221; said Lord Stafford.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Then, my lord, wilt thou bear this letter
also from me,&#8221; and Babington handed him a
small missive. &#8220;It hath given her some
uneasiness at not hearing from me, and I
would ease her mind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Yes, Anthony; the letter shall be given
her with these others.&#8221; Lord Stafford concealed
it in his belt. &#8220;Methinks that thou
art in a bad way, my lad.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;More anon,&#8221; said Babington. &#8220;Our host
comes. Thy dinner is served, my lord.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>ON THE ROAD TO STAFFORD</h3>
</div>

<p>
Francis was so absorbed in the thoughts
engendered by the conversation that she had
just heard that she forgot all about her character
as page and her duties as such. She
was recalled to herself by a sharp reprimand
from her father:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Thy duty, Francis. Attend to the serving.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Babington turned a startled glance upon
her as she arose in obedience to her father&#8217;s
command.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;The page?&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Did he hear our
converse, my lord?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Yes; but fear not, Anthony. I would
stake mine honor upon his silence. Thou
canst be trusted, Francis?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
With heightened color, for the blood
mounted to her cheeks at the intent gaze of
the young man, the girl answered earnestly:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Yes, my lord. Naught of what I have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
heard shall pass my lips. Not even the rack
should wring it from me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Protest not too much, boy,&#8221; rebuked
Babington. &#8220;Older and wiser men than
thou have succumbed to its tortures.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;You speak words of wisdom, Anthony,&#8221;
remarked Lord Stafford. &#8220;Let us hope that
the boy will not be tried by so grievous an
instrument. Yet I do believe that he will be
discreet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;He seems a proper lad,&#8221; returned the
other. &#8220;A little backward, forsooth, but with
none of the malapertness of some pages.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Francis, now completely at ease as she
saw that the young man believed her to be
what she appeared, flashed an arch look at
her father. Lord Stafford smiled slightly,
but his countenance soon became overcast
with gravity. The meal over, the host withdrew,
and the elder man turned once more
to the younger one.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Anthony,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I must on my way,
but let me plead with thee that if thou dost
entertain a thought of such rash emprises as
thy words suggest, to forego them. Naught
but disaster could follow upon such projects.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My lord, say no more an thou lovest me,&#8221;
replied Babington. &#8220;Mary&#8217;s sufferings cry
aloud for vengeance. Sleeping or waking her
wrongs are before me. My lord, she is a prisoner;
made to submit to privations that even
the basest criminals do not undergo. Couldst
thou have seen her at Tutbury or Wingfield
as I have done, you would wonder no
longer that deeds of blood suggest themselves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Anthony, thou art mad,&#8221; exclaimed Lord
Stafford compassionately.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Mad! nay; but Mary Stuart hath languished
too long in her chains. I would dare
anything to release her from them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;And so would we all who love and reverence
her as the true heiress of England&#8217;s
crown, Anthony. Yet I fear that thou dost
meditate wrong to Elizabeth, but surely thou
wouldst not raise thy hand against a
woman?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Ay, my lord! Against a woman, or what
not for Mary&#8217;s sake.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;But Mary would not approve such
measure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;No; therefore do we only contemplate her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
rescue. The softness of her heart doth prevent
other aims.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Anthony,&#8221; said Lord Stafford preparing to
renew his journey, &#8220;I see that thou art ripe
for some foolhardy enterprise. I misdoubt
thy loyalty to Elizabeth, and fear that thou
wilt soon engage in mischief. Had I not
pledged mine honor to take these letters to
Mary I would have naught to do with the
matter. Thou hast raised grave doubts as to
the nature of this undertaking. I fear for
thee, for myself and family, and most of all
do I fear for Mary Stuart. Thou knowest how
eagerly Walsingham watches for an excuse to
compass her death. Remember that, Anthony,
and by the love you bear to her,
forego the thoughts that charge thy brain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Fear naught, my lord. Thy doubts carry
thee farther than the issue warrants,&#8221; said
Babington lightly.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I bid you farewell, Anthony, but my
heart is heavy with foreboding,&#8221; and Lord
Stafford embraced him. &#8220;Would that I had
known all this ere mine honor had become
involved.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Be of good cheer. You lay too much
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
stress upon the matter,&#8221; and the young man
returned his embrace. &#8220;Farewell.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Fare you well.&#8221; Lord Stafford proceeded
to the courtyard followed by Francis. When
the girl would have ridden behind him, he
motioned her silently to come beside him.
Wonderingly she obeyed, for not thus were
pages wont to travel with their lords.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My child,&#8221; said Lord Stafford when they
had left the tavern behind and were on the
old Roman road to Bath, &#8220;I have done ill in
embarking upon this emprise, and more than
ill in engaging thee in it also. There are
dark days before us, Francis.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My father,&#8221; and leaning from her horse
the girl kissed him. &#8220;No matter what befall
thou hast deemed me worthy to share thy
danger, and I will not repine. But I like not
to think that they wish to kill the queen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Think not on that, Francis,&#8221; said her
father hastily. &#8220;On that matter my heart is
heavy, though I trow such attempt will not
be made. Anthony but raves. Such thoughts
are not for thy young heart. Dismiss them, I
entreat thee.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Let us rather think only that we are to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
carry the tidings to Mary that an effort will
be made to release her. Surely it is right to
seek to relieve her suffering,&#8221; said the girl
sweetly.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;It is in very truth, my child. Thou and
I are not concerned in aught but in bearing
good news; therefore will I cheer up, sweet
chuck, though I am greatly troubled.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
And by an effort he put aside the dire forebodings
that filled his soul, and tried to enter
into the enjoyment of his daughter who, with
the elasticity of youth, had turned to the more
cheerful scenes around them.
</p>
<p>
Frequently he called her attention to some
historic spot, or pointed out the beauties of
the sylvan landscape. And thus, sometimes
in sweet converse in which Francis learned
to know her father better than she had ever
known him; at others, in long lapses of silence
the more eloquent that there was no
conversation, and in stopping for rest and refreshment
at taverns did the days pass without
further incident. Yet though nothing of
import transpired, the journey was not without
interest to Francis.
</p>
<p>
Bath, on the right bank of the river Avon,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
presented a great variety of beautiful landscape;
the old city of Gloucester, city of
churches and beloved of kings; Tewkesbury,
site of the battle between Lancastrians and
Yorkists which placed the crown upon the
head of Edward the Fourth; Worcester, with
its glorious cathedral, filled her with delight.
The beauty of the diversified scenery, consisting
of hill, vale, forest and river, the numerous
remains of Druid, British, Roman, Anglo-Saxon
and Norman to which her father called
her attention; all these things contributed to
her pleasure, and served to banish everything
from her mind save the happiness of the moment.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;And now, Francis,&#8221; said Lord Stafford on
the evening of the fourth day, &#8220;yonder lies
Stafford, and we are near the end of our
travel. Behold, on yon mount, called &#8216;Castle
Hill,&#8217; the place where stood a noble castle
built by William the Conqueror. He conferred
it upon Robert de Torri who took the
name de Stafford from whom, as thou dost
well ken, our family hath sprung. Art thou
weary, girl?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Yes, father, but the journey hath nevertheless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
been full of delight,&#8221; returned Francis
brightly though her drooping body spoke of
the fatigue by which she was almost overcome.
&#8220;Yet right glad am I that we are
come to Stafford. And on the morrow it
may be that I shall see Queen Mary.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Mayhap, child. But now put from thee
all thought save that of rest. Let the morrow
bring what it will, this night shall be devoted
to quiet and repose.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Putting spurs to his horse the tired animal
renewed his speed, and they were soon within
the gates of the city.

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>A GLIMPSE OF MARY</h3>
</div>

<p>
Francis&#8217; wish of beholding the Queen of
Scots was gratified in a most unexpected
manner.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Do you remain here, my child,&#8221; said
Lord Stafford the next morning. &#8220;I would
behold for myself if what I have heard of
Mary&#8217;s keeper, Sir Amyas Paulet, be true.
If he be not so strict as report hath it, access
to Mary may be easy. I would rather, if it
be possible, that the matter be dispatched
without employ of thee.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;But thou wouldst still let me see Mary,
father?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;By my troth, I would. Thou hast well
merited it. But now farewell for a season.
When I return we can tell better how to conclude
this business.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My father, what shall I do until thy return?
Could I not go forth to the place
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
where stood the castle of our ancestors? I
would fain examine it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Lord Stafford hesitated for a moment before
replying, and then said thoughtfully:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Thou mayst, if thou wilt. I know that I
need not tell thee to remember that though
thou dost wear a man&#8217;s habit thou art still in
truth a maid, and to demean thyself in accordance
therewith. But still as thou dost
wear the habit, more of liberty may be given
thee than otherwise thou couldst enjoy.
Yes; go to Castle Hill, an thou wishest, but
say to none what and for why we tarry in
the town.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I am thy daughter, sir,&#8221; said Francis
proudly. &#8220;Thou dost deem me worthy to
abet thy enterprises. I will so bear myself
that thou couldst ask no more of me than if
I were thy son.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;No more,&#8221; said Lord Stafford smilingly.
&#8220;Thou leavest me with no regret that thou
art not my son. A son could do no more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
He kissed her and left the chamber.
Francis followed after him to the courtyard
of the inn where she stood watching him until
he was lost to view. Then drawing her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
cloak about her she left the yard, and walked
slowly toward the eminence upon which the
great castle formerly stood.
</p>
<p>
The ruins were interesting and served to
entertain the girl for some time, but at length
becoming weary, it occurred to her to set forth
to meet her father.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;It seems long since he started,&#8221; she mused.
&#8220;It cannot be a great while ere he returns.
Therefore to beguile my loneliness I will go to
meet him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Passing through the gates of the town she
struck boldly into the open plain through
which the road ran to Chartley. On and on
she walked, the road turning and winding
until at length it forked; one branch going to
the left, the other to the right. Francis
paused in bewilderment.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Which shall I take?&#8221; she asked herself
looking first at one and then at the other.
&#8220;My faith, but either stretches forth invitingly.
I have it! I will cast my dagger, and
traverse that one toward which it points.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
So saying she unsheathed a small poniard
from her belt and drew herself up to cast the
weapon, when the clatter of horses&#8217; hoofs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
broke upon her ear. She looked up startled.
From behind a bend in the road to the right
there came at full gallop a party consisting of
several men and a lady. Francis was so
amazed at their sudden appearance that she
still retained her position, the dagger poised
ready for the throw. With a cry of horror
the lady spurred her horse to her side.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Boy,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;what art thou about to
do? Stay thy hand, I command. Knowest
thou not that self-destruction is forbid?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Francis gave vent to a merry peal of laughter
as the lady&#8217;s meaning flashed upon her.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Be not dismayed, fair lady,&#8221; she said doffing
her bonnet and making a deep courtesy.
&#8220;I was not planning self-destruction. Life
holds too much of promise to end it now. I
was but wondering which of these two roads
led to Chartley, and thought to follow the one
toward which a throw of the dagger would
point.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The lady joined in the laugh, and then became
grave.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;To Chartley?&#8221; she said. &#8220;And what
wouldst thou at Chartley?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
It was on the tip of the girl&#8217;s tongue to reply,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
&#8220;I go to meet my father,&#8221; but she caught
herself in time. None must know of his
journey there, and even though she who
asked were beautiful and gracious she must
be discreet.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I wished to see Queen Mary,&#8221; she answered
after a moment&#8217;s hesitation.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;To see Mary?&#8221; broke in one of the men
who had drawn near during the above colloquy.
&#8220;And may I ask, young sir, what business
thou hast with Mary?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Why, why,&#8221; stammered Francis abashed
by his harsh address and rude bearing. &#8220;I
have no business. I only wished to see the
queen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Queen forsooth! Of what is she queen?&#8221;
asked the other brusquely. &#8220;Of nothing, I
trow. Not even is she mistress of her own
actions. Queen forsooth!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Thou speakest truly, Paulet,&#8221; said the lady
mildly. &#8220;Yet methinks it not becoming in
thee to taunt Mary Stuart with the miserable
state to which she hath been reduced. Boy,
thou didst wish to see Mary. I am she.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Mary? Art thou in truth Queen Mary?&#8221;
Francis exclaimed rapturously, and seeing the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
assenting smile on the lady&#8217;s face she darted
to her side and seizing her hand she kissed it
fervently. &#8220;Oh,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;if thou art
Mary, know that mistress of thy actions thou
mayst not be, but thou dost reign in truth a
queen over this poor heart.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The dark eyes of Mary Stuart filled with
tears and she pressed the girl&#8217;s hand tenderly.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Such homage is sweet to the poor captive,
my lad. It gladdens our heart to know that
there are some who still hold Mary in reverence.
Take this and wear in remembrance of
her who is grateful for even the homage of a
page.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
She drew from her neck a chain of gold to
which was attached a locket which she threw
over the girl&#8217;s head. With an exclamation of
delight Francis pressed it to her lips passionately.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;It shall never leave me while life lasts,&#8221;
she declared. &#8220;But may I not wait upon you
at your castle, Your Highness? I would be
of service to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Her eyes sought the lady&#8217;s with a meaning
look that Mary was quick to catch.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay;&#8221; broke in Sir Amyas Paulet for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
the gruff old puritan was very rigid with
his illustrious captive. &#8220;Thou hast had thy
wish, boy, and obtained what was doubtless
thy object: a chain for a kiss, a locket for an
obeisance. It pays to give court to reduced
royalty. Away with thee, and let me not see
thy face at Chartley, else thou shalt meet a
gruff reception.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Then farewell.&#8221; Francis drew as close to
the lady&#8217;s side as she could. &#8220;There are
letters,&#8221; she whispered.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Away!&#8221; Sir Amyas laid a hand upon the
bridle of Mary&#8217;s horse and turned the animal
from the girl. &#8220;I will have no whisperings.
Away, boy!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Be not overcome, my pretty lad,&#8221; and
Mary drew rein despite the protests of her
uncivil guardian. &#8220;We thank thee for thy
homage, and hope to see thee again when we
journey forth. Farewell.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Farewell,&#8221; returned Francis sinking upon
one knee and saluting her. &#8220;I will see you
again, Your Grace.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
With an impatient exclamation Sir Amyas
Paulet gave a sharp blow to Mary&#8217;s horse,
which reared and plunged at the treatment,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
almost unseating the lady, able horsewoman
though she was. The animal then dashed
away followed by the grim old puritan and
the remainder of the party who had halted
at some little distance from them.
</p>
<p>
As soon as they were out of sight Francis
took the locket in her hand.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;And I have seen Mary,&#8221; she said with
gladness. &#8220;How it will surprise my father.
How beautiful is the locket, and how full of
graciousness and sweetness she is! Service
in her behalf must be a joy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
She turned and retraced her steps toward
Stafford unmindful of the fact that she had
started to meet her father.
</p>
<p>
It had been morning when Lord Stafford
had left his daughter; the sun was declining
in the west when, discouraged and low in
spirit, he returned to the tavern!
</p>
<p>
&#8220;It is even worse than report hath it,&#8221;
he said as he entered the apartment where
Francis awaited him. &#8220;Chartley is as much
a prison for Mary as the tower itself would
be. When I sought admission to its gates I
was refused and threatened, forsooth. The
manor is surrounded by a moat and is well
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
defended. The walls can be scaled only by
birds. Methinks that there is cause for Babington&#8217;s
wild frenzy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Father,&#8221; spoke Francis demurely, though
there was exultation in her tones, &#8220;I saw
Mary.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My child, what do you say?&#8221; ejaculated
Lord Stafford in surprise. &#8220;How couldst
thou? You were not at Chartley.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nathless I saw the queen,&#8221; and Francis
laughed gleefully. &#8220;See what she graciously
gave me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Her father took the chain and locket in
his hands and examined them closely.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;It doth indeed come from Mary,&#8221; he said
looking at the name, Marie R, engraved
upon it. &#8220;Thou hast accomplished wonders,
Francis. Tell me how the matter fell
out?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Francis related all that had happened.
Lord Stafford listened intently.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Sir Amyas is an austere jailer,&#8221; he observed.
&#8220;He thinketh to do his duty more
acceptably to Elizabeth by treating Mary with
rigor. Mary is quick of wit, and I doubt not
that this will put her on the alert. Child, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
must trust to thy wit to help me in this.
Canst thou compass it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I am sure so,&#8221; answered Francis with the
confidence of youth. &#8220;To-morrow I will
again repair to the forked roads, and mayhap
she will be there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Mayhap,&#8221; said her father, &#8220;but I misdoubt
it. Paulet may be suspicious of thee,
but &#8217;twill do no harm to be there. We will
try to get the letters to her, but if we do
not succeed then must Ballard, or Captain
Fortescue as he calls himself, find some other
means of communicating with her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;We will succeed. Never fear,&#8221; said
Francis with conviction.

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>FRANCIS TO THE FRONT</h3>
</div>

<p>
The next morning Francis was early at the
crossroads but although she waited for several
hours neither Mary nor any of her party appeared.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;It is as I thought it would be,&#8221; said Lord
Stafford, &#8220;but we must not be discouraged.
You must go to the same place for several days.
I feel sure that if Mary can compass it she
will fare that way again. It is our only hope
of opening up communication with her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Three more days passed without result, but
on the morning of the fourth day a cavalcade
appeared. Francis was delighted to see Mary
in their midst. Not as before on a horse but
in a coach. As she stood with uncovered
head the party swept by her without stopping.
The queen bowed and smiled, but
when the girl would have darted to the side
of the coach she was prevented by the gentlemen
of the guard who closed around it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Oh,&#8221; cried the girl, tears of disappointment
streaming from her eyes, &#8220;what shall I
do? What can I do?&#8221; But the equipage
swept on bearing Mary from her sight and
Francis gave way to her grief unrestrainedly.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;And I thought to have done so much,&#8221;
she murmured when she had become calm.
&#8220;Ah! my father did well to say that Sir
Amyas was an austere man. Little doth it
comfort Mary to be a queen when there is
such an one to control her actions. Well, I
must to the inn.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
She turned to go back to the town when
her eye was caught by a filmy bit of linen
which was caught in a bush by the wayside.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;&#8217;Twas hers,&#8221; cried Francis catching it up
eagerly. &#8220;How foolish to repine when I
should have known that there would be some
sign.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Examining the dainty bit of cloth carefully
she found it covered over with a lot of
characters whose meaning she could not
fathom.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I must take it to my father,&#8221; she said concealing
the linen in her bosom. &#8220;Mayhap he
can decipher it.&#8221; And she hastened to return
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
to the tavern joyful at having obtained at
least a token.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;It is written in cipher,&#8221; remarked Lord
Stafford, examining the bit of cloth attentively.
&#8220;It is my good fortune to have
the key to some of the ciphers which she uses.
It may be that it is the one that will unravel
the meaning of this for us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Francis awaited the result with impatience
while her father applied himself to the task
of deciphering the characters. Presently he
looked up triumphantly.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I have it, child. Mary is in truth on the
alert. She knows that we have messages for
her. Listen! she says: &#8216;I find no security in
writing by carrier; the best recipe for secret
writing is alum dissolved in a little clear water
twenty-four hours before it is required to write
with. In order to read it the paper must be
wetted in a basin of water and then held to
the fire; the secret writing then appears white
and may easily be read until the paper gets
dry. You may write in this manner on white
taffeta or white linen, especially lawn; and
as a token when anything is written on a
piece of taffeta or linen a little snip can be cut
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
off from one of the corners. Friend, if so be
that you have letters, transcribe their message
in the above manner. As to the manner of
their delivery I know not. I will this way as
often as the disposition of my jailer will permit.
Adieu, my friend&mdash;though I know not
thy name, yet thy features are engraved upon
the heart of your queen,
</p>
<p style='text-align: right; margin-right:2%'>
&#8216;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>MARIE, ROYNE.</span>&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;There!&#8221; Lord Stafford smoothed the
piece of cloth complacently. &#8220;The thing
that troubles is how to give her the papers
and letters. &#8217;Tis my belief that they would
be as easy to deliver as to transcribe their contents
upon cloth to give her. She must be
made aware of the plan for her rescue.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;What is the plan, father?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;To overwhelm her escort while she is taking
the air, child. Babington is to come with
one hundred men and carry Mary off. Her
escort seldom consists of more than eighteen
or twenty men, and we think she might be
easily taken from them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;But would not other of Sir Amyas&#8217;s men
follow after and retake her?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;We hope to place her in a secure spot ere
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
they could do so, Francis. Once across the
border Elizabeth would have no power over
her, and her son, unfilial though he hath
shown himself, could not for very shame refuse
her safe asylum. Then she might, if she
would so choose, retire to France where she
could dwell in peace.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;She must have those letters, my father.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Yes, Francis; but how? My mind plays
me false when I would discover a way. It is
not active. We must think, think, Francis.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Francis arose and walked to the window
where she stood abstractedly looking
through the lattice which overhung a large
yard, surrounded by the stables of the hostelry.
Some yeomen were dressing their own
or their masters&#8217; horses, whistling, singing and
laughing. Suddenly she bent forward
eagerly.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My father,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;prithee come
here!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;What is it, Francis?&#8221; asked Lord Stafford
joining her.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Dost see the boy on the cart that has just
entered the yard?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;What is he, think you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My child, he is a carter. What doth
make thee so full of interest in him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Might it not be that as a carter he would
go to Chartley sometimes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Gramercy! I see thy meaning. How
full of wit thou art!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Francis smiled, much gratified.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;If it can be compassed would it not be
excellent to enter Chartley as a carter? The
thing is to get within the gates. Then the
delivery of the letters would be easy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;&#8217;Tis excellently thought of, child, but
there are guards within as well. &#8217;Twould
still require adroitness to accomplish the
rest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Trust me! If I can get within, the rest
shall follow,&#8221; said she with great determination.
&#8220;I will enter into talk with that carter
and see what can be done with him. My
father, do I bear myself in a manner befitting
my garb?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Thou art a very model of pagehood, Francis.
Go, my child. Heavy as the burden
of this emprise is it seems to have shifted
its weight to thy shoulders. Find if the lad
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
goes to Chartley, and if so, the way may
be opened for us to enter therein. Divers
means must be employed to accomplish our
aims.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The girl left the chamber and, assuming
the careless frowardness of a page, sauntered
into the yard.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Good-morrow, my lad,&#8221; she said, stopping
by the side of the boy who was busily engaged
in removing sacks, baskets and other receptacles
from the cart.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Good-morrow, young sir,&#8221; returned the
wight civilly. &#8220;It hath been some days since
I saw your worshipful sir. Methought that
you had gone away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay; I tarry here still for there is good
cheer to be found at the Red Hand,&#8221; quoth
Francis with a bold swagger. &#8220;How busy
thou art.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Yes; the likes o&#8217; us have to be. What
with loading the cart, delivering, and unloading
again, and caring for the nag I find the
time full.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;And where doth it all go, lad?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;To Chartley, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Chartley? Is not that where Mary of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
Scotland is confined?&#8221; asked Francis, trying
to speak indifferently.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;The very place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Didst ever see her, boy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Why, yes, my young master. Many a
time and oft since she hath been at Chartley.
She takes the air in the early morning in the
gardens and I have seen her there when I
drove in with my cart.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I would that I might see her. Could I&mdash;could
I go with you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The youth stared for a moment and then
answered soberly:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;It is forbid to us to carry aught besides
our wares within the gates. And Sir Amyas is
that particular that I misdoubt if he would
let you enter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Still I would like to try. &#8217;Tis only for a
sight of the queen. And see! here is a gold
piece that thou canst have. Do let me go with
thee, Will. Thy name is Will?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;That is my name, sir.&#8221; Will&#8217;s hand
closed over the gold but he still appeared reluctant.
&#8220;Well, it shall be as you wish, my
young master. But you must wear other
garb than that, else you cannot enter.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;What habit shall I wear, good Will?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I will give thee my cloak and bonnet,
master. I durst not do this if thou shouldst
want else but to look at the queen. But what
harm is there in that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;What in truth, Will? A cat may look at
a king, I trow. When do you go again?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;To-morrow. Wouldst go then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Ay, Will.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Then, my master, you must be up with
the lark for we start early.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I will be ready. Then farewell until then.
Thou wilt not regret thy favor to me, Will, I
promise thee.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I hope not, master.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Thou wilt not. Farewell till the morrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
And Francis ran lightly back to her father
to report the result of the interview.

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>THE DELIVERY OF THE LETTERS</h3>
</div>

<p>
Will was disposed to be taciturn on the
way to Chartley. Francis did not know
whether he suspected her design was more
than to see Mary or not, but summoning all
the finesse of which she was mistress she made
herself as agreeable as she could, relating
stories and incidents of the chase, until long
before the plain which lay between Stafford
and Chartley was crossed, Will&#8217;s surliness had
vanished.
</p>
<p>
The sun was an hour high when they
reached their destination. Chartley, grim
and gray in the morning light, rose before
them. The manor was large and roomy, surrounded
by such a high wall that none, unless
he were endowed with the wings of a bird,
could scale its heights. A moat encompassed
the whole. The castle with wall and moat
forming a stronghold well suited to its present
use as prison.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
</p>
<p>
As they crossed the drawbridge and entered
the portals Francis was surprised to see sentinels
everywhere. Her spirit sank a little and
her heart quailed as she noted all of the
means employed to insure Mary&#8217;s safe-keeping.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My father was right,&#8221; she thought. &#8220;To
obtain entrance is not all. There will still be
difficulty, I fear, in seeing her. What if she
comes not to the garden? But courage!
Poor lady! I marvel not that she doth wish
to gain her liberty. Methinks I should die
were I to be deprived of my freedom!&#8221; Thus
she mused little dreaming that not many
weeks would elapse ere she would be put to
the test.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;There are the gardens,&#8221; said Will breaking
in upon her thoughts. &#8220;&#8217;Tis there that I
have often seen the queen. See, the guard is
leaving.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Don&#8217;t they guard her through the day,
Will?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Ay, master. But the sentinels stand not
at the doors and windows as they do at night.
The walls only are guarded through the day.
There she is, forsooth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I see her not, good Will.&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='silver' />

<p>
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 360px;'>
<i>QUEEN MARY&#8217;S WIT GRASPED THE SITUATION</i><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>
&#8220;In the main garden, master. To the
right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Francis looked in the direction indicated
and soon descried the form of a woman
seated in a large rolling chair which was
wheeled by an attendant. Along the walks
of the garden they went pausing ever and
anon to pluck some flower or the cherries
which were ripening in the sun. For a moment
only Francis gazed and then, before
Will had time to say her nay, she leaped off
from the wagon and bounded swiftly in the
direction of the garden.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Uds!&#8221; growled Will his mouth agape
with astonishment. &#8220;Methought there was
more to &#8217;t than appeared,&#8221; and he went on to
the kitchens.
</p>
<p>
Meantime Francis, trampling over flowers
and vegetables in her haste, reached the side
of Mary, and thrust into her hand the package
of letters. Mary&#8217;s quick wit grasped the
situation instantly. Concealing the papers
about her she drew back from the seeming
carter, crying in a loud voice for she saw one
of the guards approaching:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Well, what meaneth this? Forgive me,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
she whispered hurriedly, &#8220;if I seem angry.
&#8217;Tis but for thine own safety.&#8221; So saying she
drew back still further from the kneeling girl
exclaiming as the guard came up, &#8220;I know
thee not, boy. Why dost thou trouble me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I wished to see thee,&#8221; murmured Francis
rising. &#8220;Forgive me. I wished&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;There!&#8221; said Mary. &#8220;&#8217;Tis no matter.
Barbara,&#8221; to her companion, &#8220;hast thou the
purse? Give the lad a groat. Marry! thou
art all alike. Ye wish bounty whether ye deserve
it or not. Go, and trouble me no more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
She turned as she spoke and without another
glance at the girl passed back to the
house. Francis stood looking at the coin for
a moment undecided what to do for she saw
that Will&#8217;s cart was nowhere in sight.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Get thee gone,&#8221; said the guard coming toward
her menacingly. He had overheard
Mary&#8217;s remarks and noted her demeanor, and
thought that the carter lad before him was
really seeking to profit by Mary&#8217;s well-known
generosity. &#8220;Go, fellow! or I will take thee
to my master. And if thou troublest the
lady again, I will run thee through with my
rapier. Go!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
</p>
<p>
Without a word in reply, glad to have the
matter end so, Francis followed him meekly
as he led her to the kitchen doors where Will
and other carters were busy unloading their
wagons.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;With which of you came this fellow?&#8221;
demanded the guard.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;With me, master,&#8221; spoke Will sullenly.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;See that he accompanies thee no more.
&#8217;Tis a mischievous wight and like to get into
trouble. Quick with thy load. I wish to
see thy cart safely beyond the gates.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Will,&#8221; said Francis when they were once
more outside the gates, &#8220;art angry with
me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Ay! &#8217;twere an ill turn that thou did
serve me,&#8221; growled Will. &#8220;&#8217;Twere an ill
turn, master.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Forgive me, and you shall have this groat
that the queen gave me,&#8221; and Francis handed
him the coin. &#8220;My lord, I know, will give
me more to give thee.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Well, mayhap it be all right,&#8221; said Will
somewhat mollified, &#8220;but you go no more,
young master.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;No, Will; I will not ask it of thee. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
have both seen and spoken with the lady.
What more need I?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;No more, I&#8217;ll be bound, master,&#8221; growled
Will. &#8220;There was more in&#8217;t than seeing and
speaking, I&#8217;ll warrant. But I ken none of it.
Here we are at Stafford, master.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I thank you, Will, for your courtesy,&#8221;
said Francis sweetly as she left him.
</p>
<p>
Lord Stafford was awaiting her return anxiously.
He folded her close to his breast as
she entered his chamber, saying earnestly:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Thank Heaven, my daughter, that thou
hast returned safely to me. Not for all the
queens in the world would I have thee adventure
such a thing again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Why, &#8217;twas naught,&#8221; laughed the girl.
&#8220;Mary hath the letters now. &#8217;Twas not hard
to give them after all.&#8221; She recounted the
whole affair.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Well hast thou done, my child. There
will need to be further communication with
Mary, but not from us. We have done our
part. No more of plots or conspiracies will I
have, and never again will I subject thee to
such danger. Now we will wend homeward
to allay the anxiety of thy mother. Whenever
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
I have need of a quick wit and a nimble
brain I will call on thee.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Glad am I to have pleased thee,&#8221; returned
Francis. &#8220;There is naught that I would not
undertake for thee, my father.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I believe it, Francis.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The next morning early they set forth on
the return journey. Lord Stafford seemed to
have thrown aside the weight of misgiving
that had oppressed him on his way thither,
and was full of the gayest spirits. With
laughter and story did he beguile the way,
and once as he jestingly spoke of her attire,
he said laughingly,
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Listen, Francis, and I will tell thee of
another such an one. Hast thou ever heard
how the serving man became a queen?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;The serving man a queen?&#8221; cried the
girl. &#8220;Why how could that be, father?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Listen, and you shall hear.&#8221; In a rich
full voice he trolled the following ballad:
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto; '>

Francis laughed merrily when he finished.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Poor Williame! but it ended well after
all. Well, my days for man&#8217;s attire will
soon be o&#8217;er.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;&#8217;Tis to be hoped so,&#8221; answered her father.
&#8220;Though the dress well becomes thee.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
At length, though they had returned by
easier stages than they had performed the
journey to Stafford, Lyndhurst was reached,
and soon the turrets of Stafford Hall became
visible.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Home again, my child,&#8221; spoke Lord
Stafford cheerily. &#8220;Right glad am I to enter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
its gates once more. How is it with thee,
Francis? Thou hast fared widely. Dost
still revere thy home?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;More than ever, my <a name="period" id="period"></a><ins class="trnote" title="Transcriber&#8217;s note: changed from a comma in original text">father.</ins> Never have
I seen it look so beautiful. Even the stones
seem to smile a welcome.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Marry, there stands my lady wife! Look,
she sees us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
With a cry of joy the lady ran to greet
them.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Ye are safe,&#8221; she cried embracing them.
&#8220;Ah, but it hath been long, long since ye left.
Methought something had befallen you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;No; my sweet wife. Weary we may be
with the journey, and ready for the good
cheer which we know awaits us, but well
otherwise. How now, sweet chuck? Thou
art pale, and even though thou hast us safe
with thee, yet doth thy lip still quiver, and
thy form tremble. What is it? Speak,
madam, I beseech thee.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My lord, I wot not what to think of it,
but to-day a messenger came from the queen
saying that Elizabeth in her royal progress
through Hampshire would honor us with a
visit.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Elizabeth here?&#8221; cried Lord Stafford in
astonishment. &#8220;Art sure?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Sure, my lord. What doth it portend?
Is there hidden menace in the fact? Doth
she suspect, think you, that Ballard hath been
here? My lord, what can it mean?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Madam, I know not. We are her subjects.
If Her Majesty chooses to visit us we can but
receive her. But look not so pale. &#8217;Tis but
a matter of a few days&#8217; entertainment, and
surely we would do ill to be churlish of them.
It is not the first time that royalty hath honored
Stafford. Right well do I remember that
Henry, Elizabeth&#8217;s bluff old father, favored
us with a visit. With his own hand he
brought down many a fat buck in yon forest
park. Right well pleased was my father with
that visit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;True, my lord; but he had favor with
Henry, and had naught to fear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;And what is there to fear from his
daughter? We must bestir ourselves to give
the queen most royal welcome. Here she
will not find the &#8216;princely pleasures of
Kenilworth,&#8217; but nathless! hearty welcome
and good cheer are much even to a queen.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
How now, girl! Thou dost not look displeased?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Neither am I, good my father,&#8221; spoke
Francis quickly. With the natural instinct
of youth she delighted at the prospect of the
pleasures in store. &#8220;Glad will I be to see the
queen even though she be old and not so
beautiful as Mary.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Beshrew me, girl! let no such words pass
thy lips,&#8221; cried her father in consternation.
&#8220;&#8217;Twere treason, forsooth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Have no fear. I will speak naught of
that order to any save thee and my lady
mother. Discreet am I and full of matter,
but nothing will I disclose.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Thou hast need to be discreet,&#8221; replied her
mother. &#8220;Be not malapert and froward,
child.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Said the messenger when she was coming?&#8221;
now asked the nobleman.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;On the third day from this, my lord.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;&#8217;Tis but short notice for what must be
done,&#8221; mused Lord Stafford. &#8220;Supplies must
be obtained for the queen&#8217;s retinue, and pageants
prepared to amuse her. Call Greville,
my wife. Bid him hasten to the presence
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
chamber. Francis, repair to thy chamber and
rest. Thou dost merit it. It will be thy part,
madam, to attend to the ordering of the royal
apartments. As for me there will be much to
employ me during the next few days. Pray
Heaven, that Ballard come not during the
festivities.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>THE COMING OF ELIZABETH</h3>
</div>

<p>
The days that followed were full of bustle
and activity. The officers of the household
scoured the country far and near to secure
provisions and delicacies sufficient for the
queen and her retinue. Game, droves of bullocks,
sheep, hogs and great hampers of groceries
filled the larders to overflowing. Near
and remote neighbors and kinsmen embraced
the opportunity to send contributions. No
man knew when his own time might come
and sympathized accordingly. The queen
was not tolerant of any but a royal reception,
and a visit, while an honor, was not always
an unmixed blessing; as many an impoverished
nobleman could testify.
</p>
<p>
Hugh Greville, the tutor, was overjoyed at
her coming, and, as master of the pageants
preparing for the amusement of the queen,
assumed a pompous importance greatly at
variance with his usual manner.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;We must have a play, my lord,&#8221; he said
to Lord Stafford who was for the moment
idle. &#8220;Her Majesty doth take delight in a
play. This to be preceded by an address
in Latin. Latin, my lord, because the queen
is learned, and deference should be paid to
her knowledge. The welcome to be spoken
by a boy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Have what thou wilt, Greville, so that it
will please the queen,&#8221; returned the nobleman.
&#8220;I had word from my Lord of Leicester
this morning that his mummers accompanied
Elizabeth in her progress. They will
give the play with more of satisfaction, I trow,
than any of the strolling players who have
come hither. The address of welcome could
be managed, but what boy couldst thou get to
deliver it? Boys there be in plenty, but boys
with Latinity&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; and he shrugged his
shoulders.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Had your lordship only a son,&#8221; sighed
Greville regretfully, &#8220;it would be right fitting
for him to give the speech. I myself would
write it. &#8217;Twould only need to be conned
well. Ah, would that thou hadst a son!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Gramercy!&#8221; spoke Francis overhearing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
the tutor&#8217;s speech. &#8220;Hath he not a daughter?
I will give thy harangue, Master Greville.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay;&#8221; and the old man shook his head
positively. &#8220;&#8217;Twill not do, Francis. The
Queen&#8217;s Majesty would relish it more if &#8217;twere
spoken by a lad. Her heart inclineth to
them. A pretty lad, for she loves beauty.
Marry! &#8217;tis pity thou art a girl!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Father,&#8221; Francis spoke quickly, a roguish
light coming into her eyes, &#8220;I could put on
the page&#8217;s dress again, and who would be
the wiser? Not the queen, I trow, for she
doth not know whether or no thou hast a
son.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;If it might be,&#8221; said Greville eagerly.
&#8220;The girl is brighter than most lads, and
could quickly con the speech. What say
you, my lord?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Let the child have her way in this, my
lord,&#8221; spoke Lady Stafford joining them.
&#8220;Did she not don the garb to please thee?
Now that it be for her pleasure deny her not,
I entreat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;When thou pleadest for her, madam, I
cannot deny,&#8221; said her husband slowly. &#8220;I
thought never to see thee in such dress again,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
Francis. There seemed necessity for it before.
Now&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Now there is necessity also,&#8221; broke in
Francis. &#8220;Shall the queen go without her
welcome for the want of a boy? I trow not,
when Francis Stafford makes so good an one.
Fear not, my father. I have become so accustomed
to the dress that each day do I don
it. And &#8217;tis but sport.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Have thine own way,&#8221; said Lord Stafford
resignedly. &#8220;Do but honor the queen, and I
will not inquire too closely concerning the
manner.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Pleased at receiving the permission, Francis
applied herself to memorizing the speech prepared
by the tutor while the other preparations
went on royally. Elizabeth was to arrive
in the afternoon, and on the morning of
that day her master of horse, the Earl of
Leicester, with his stepson, the Earl of
Essex, came to see that everything was in
readiness. Then in company with Lord Stafford
they went forth to escort the queen to
the Hall.
</p>
<p>
A great concourse of people stood without
the gates. Lord Stafford&#8217;s retainers were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
drawn up on either side of the base court
ready to shout a welcome so soon as the queen
appeared. At the top of the stairs leading to
the terrace stood Francis arrayed in doublet
and hose of purple velvet. A short cloak of
the material hung gracefully from her shoulders.
A purple velvet bonnet with a long
white feather crowned her head. Her curls
were blown about her cheeks by the breeze;
her color was coming and going for she was
somewhat dismayed at the magnitude of the
task she had set herself. Stories that she had
heard of the great queen&#8217;s anger at those who
failed to perform well their parts rushed to
her mind and almost overwhelmed her with
confusion.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Courage,&#8221; whispered Greville who stood
near her. &#8220;Courage, girl. Remember who
thou art, and whom thou art to welcome.
Do thy father credit, else I will repent me of
having intrusted so important a duty to thee.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I will, good cousin,&#8221; returned Francis her
spirit rising at his words. &#8220;Not even the
presence of the queen shall make me forget
what is due my father. But hark!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
A blare of trumpets sounded without the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
gates. The bell in the tower, used only upon
great occasions, pealed forth merrily. The
musicians stationed in court, terrace, and hall
struck up, and viols, sackbuts, cornets and
recorders sounded, while from the retainers
and people who thronged the roads and the
court there went up a great shout of acclamation
as a glittering cavalcade appeared.
</p>
<p>
The dresses of the courtiers were a blaze of
splendor remarkable even in that imaginative
age. First rode the Earl of Leicester, magnificent
in black satin, his horse richly caparisoned
with embroidered furnishings. On
the right of the queen was the Earl of Essex
resplendent in cloth of silver. Upon her left,
rode Sir Walter Raleigh gorgeous in white
satin raiment. Back of them came the ladies
of the court, maids of honor, and the gentlemen.
In the midst of all these was the one
upon whom all eyes were bent&mdash;Elizabeth.
She was attired in white silk bordered with
pearls the size of beans, and over it a mantle
of black silk shot with silver threads. Instead
of a chain she had an oblong collar of
gold and jewels. Her air was stately, and as
she passed along in great state and magnificence,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
she bowed graciously first to one side
and then to the other. Wherever she turned
her face the people fell upon their knees,
crying,&mdash;&#8220;God save the queen, Elizabeth!&#8221;
To which she replied,&mdash;&#8220;I thank you, my
good people.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
At the foot of the terrace she alighted from
her chariot, and, escorted by Lord Stafford,
ascended the steps and approached the place
where Francis stood. The girl gazed at her
earnestly, mentally contrasting her with Mary
of Scotland.
</p>
<p>
Elizabeth was very stately though her
stature was not great; her face, oblong, fair
but wrinkled; her eyes small, yet black and
pleasant; her nose a little hooked; her lips
narrow and compressed; her teeth black as
were most of the ladies&#8217; teeth at that period
from the excessive use of sugar. She wore a
wig of false red hair; and upon her head sat
a small crown of gold reported to be made of
some of the celebrated Lunebourg table.
When she reached the terrace two cannons
were shot off; the one filled with a sweet
powder; the other with sweet water, odoriferous
and pleasant; the firing being imitated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
by a crash of instruments. When the noise
of these had died away Francis stepped
forward, and began timidly, gaining self-possession
as she proceeded:
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto; '>
<tr><td><p style='margin-top:0.5em; margin-bottom:0.0em'>
&#8220;Oh Excellent Queen! true adamant of hearts,

Welcome, and thrice welcome!
</p></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
&#8220;O lady, that doth ennoble the title you
possess, with the honor of your worthiness,
rather crowning the great crown that derives
fame from having so excellent an owner, than
you receiving to yourself any ornament therefrom;
vouchsafe with patient attention to
hear the words which I, by commandment,
am here to deliver unto you. Disdain not to
smile upon our feeble efforts to entertain you,
yet do I dare warrant myself so far upon the
show of rare beauty, as that malice cannot
fall from so fair a mind. Welcome! This
hall and all it contains are yours. Do with
them as you list, fair queen, but oh, disdain
not to breathe your favor upon us. Welcome
and thrice welcome to these portals! Loving
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
hearts greet you, and declare you queen of
them as well as of Love and Beauty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Elizabeth listened smilingly, and as the girl
concluded she passed her hand over her
auburn curls saying affably:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Well done, thou pretty lad! I like well
the spirit as well as the delivery of it. Thy
Latinity holds much to be commended. And
what may be thy name?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Francis Stafford, may it please Your
Grace.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;It does please me. Francis? Ah, well
do I ken that was the name of thy father, my
lord,&#8221; and she turned to Lord Stafford.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;You speak aright, Your Highness,&#8221;
answered he.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Thou shalt come to me anon, thou pretty
lad, for I would speak with thee further,&#8221;
said the queen as she moved away. &#8220;Hast
thou other children, my lord?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;This is mine only one,&#8221; replied Lord
Stafford.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;And was the welcome of your composing?&#8221;
queried she.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay; I am not so ready with the pen,&#8221;
laughed Stafford. &#8220;I am not a Sidney, my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
liege. Greville did it. Dost remember
him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Assuredly. Where is he? Ah, Greville,&#8221;
as the tutor overwhelmed with rapture at her
notice, threw himself on his knees before her,
and seizing the hand which she graciously
extended to him, covered it with kisses.
&#8220;Art well?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Ah, madam, madam,&#8221; murmured the
old man, &#8220;can you ask that when it hath
been so long since I have been in your presence?
As well expect the flower to flourish
without the rays of the sun.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;There, flatterer,&#8221; said the queen tapping
him lightly on the shoulder to Francis&#8217;
amazement for she expected her to take no
notice of such adulation. &#8220;Thou must come
to the court oftener, Greville.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Greville arose as she passed on, his face
aglow with gratification.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Child, is she not the most gracious, the
most lovely of sovereigns?&#8221; he whispered to
Francis.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Gracious, I grant thee, cousin; but lovely,
no. My mother is fairer by far than she.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Hark ye, lad,&#8221; said a courtier who had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
overheard the girl&#8217;s words, &#8220;a hint in thine
ear: repeat not that speech. Nay; think it
not even. It behooves thee, and me, and all
of us to believe that the queen is the loveliest,
the fairest, and the most learned of all women,
bar none; which she is. God bless her!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;God bless Elizabeth,&#8221; echoed Greville
fervently, but Francis, with a haughty look
at the speaker, turned upon her heel, and
entered the hall.

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>THE QUEEN TAKES OFFENSE</h3>
</div>

<p>
The queen at length reached the great hall
of the castle, gorgeously hung with tapestries
for her reception, and resounding to the
strains of soft and delicious music. At the
upper end of the chamber was a throne and
beside it a door which opened into a suite of
apartments for the queen whenever it should
be her pleasure to be private. The hall was
thronged with spectators, for a masque was to
be given, and menials as well as courtiers
were interested in the pageant.
</p>
<p>
Francis mingled with the crowd purposing
to retire very soon to her bower to don habit
more befitting her sex, but enjoying for the
nonce the freedom which her garb gave her.
Presently she felt her cloak twitched as some
one said:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Where is your sister, sir? I see her not
among those who attend the queen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My sister?&#8221; The girl wheeled about,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
and uttered an exclamation of amazement
as she recognized the speaker. &#8220;What dost
thou here?&#8221; she demanded sternly. &#8220;And
why art thou in that attire?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The boy, for it was the lad who had shot
the deer in the chase, gave vent to a low
laugh.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I came to see the queen. Why should I
not? I am her leal and true subject, which
is more than thou canst say even if thou
didst rattle off her welcome so glibly in
Latin. As for my dress, it is my own. Why
should I not wear it, Master Stafford?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I am as true a subject to the queen as
thou art,&#8221; retorted Francis. &#8220;Why art thou
here? Thou shouldst be in durance for the
deer which thou didst shoot in the forest,&#8221;
and a sneer curled her lips.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;So she told you of it,&#8221; exclaimed the
lad.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;She? Whom mean you?&#8221; queried
Francis in bewilderment.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Thy sister, stupid. How else couldst
thou have known of the deer? Truly, thou
art as much like her as one pea is to another.
Should you but don her frock there would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
be none that could tell ye apart. Where is
she?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Francis laughed outright as the lad&#8217;s mistake
dawned upon her, and a merry twinkle
came into her eyes.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My sister is occupied,&#8221; she answered
mischievously. &#8220;Marry! it were well for
thee that it was she with whom thou didst
dispute over the deer. But thou hast been
punished enough, else I would not let thee
leave this hall before thou wouldst feel the
weight of my whip.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Beshrew me, I like not thy brag,&#8221; cried
the other angrily. &#8220;Know, Master Stafford,
that I was not punished. So soon as the
keepers found who and what I was they
made apology for treating me in such an
unmannerly fashion, and brought me the
horns of the deer as trophy of my skill.
They now repose in mine own abode.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Brought thee the horns in trophy of thy
skill?&#8221; repeated the girl in wrathful incredulity.
&#8220;Brought them to thee, forsooth!
Why, minion, thou didst not kill the deer.
I slew it myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Marry! dost thou take thy sister&#8217;s quarrel
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
upon thee,&#8221; cried the boy. &#8220;Know then that
I slew it, and I am ready to maintain the
matter by force of arms.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Francis,&#8221; Greville came up opportunely
at this moment, &#8220;thou art forgetting thyself.
Thy mother wishes thy presence. Why doth
thou show choler toward this lad? Why, it
is the lad who shot the deer!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;You too, Greville,&#8221; exclaimed Francis
bitterly. &#8220;I think the sight of Elizabeth
hath addled thy wits. As for you, young sir,
&#8217;tis well that my duty to my mother calls
me hence else thou shouldst not get off so
easily.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;At another time then,&#8221; replied the boy,
&#8220;thou wilt find me at thy service. We can
settle our difference then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Now heaven forfend!&#8221; ejaculated the
tutor urging Francis away. &#8220;This comes of
donning male habit. I will report the matter
to my lady, Francis. She will see to&#8217;t that
thou dost conduct thyself in more seemly
manner. &#8217;Twould but amuse my lord.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Keep a still tongue in thy head, cousin,&#8221;
said the girl sharply. &#8220;Meddle not with that
that doth not concern thee. Couldst thou
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
not see that the fellow did but laud himself?
The varlet dare not meet me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Methought he spoke not without courage,&#8221;
observed Greville. &#8220;I should judge by his
dress that his rank was equal to thine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;His dress, forsooth! What doth hinder
any hind from appearing in rich attire?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;The law of the queen. It regulates dress
according to rank, and works with severity
against those who dare transgress it,&#8221; returned
Greville. &#8220;There stands thy lady mother.
I entreat thee, girl, abide close by her side
during the queen&#8217;s visit else thy sharp tongue
may work mischief for all of us. My lady,
here is the child.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Lady Stafford who stood near the queen
and her ladies looked reproachfully at her
daughter.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Hast thou not changed thy garb yet, my
child?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;It behooves thee to do
so at once for it savors of disrespect to the
queen not to appear in other array.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay;&#8221; said Elizabeth who had overheard
her words. &#8220;The lad is well enough as he is.
We warrant that he wished not to miss any of
this pageant which hath been prepared in our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
honor. He shall attend us in our own chamber
to which we and our ladies will now retire
for some privacy. Come, my boy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Much embarrassed Lady Stafford strove to
stammer forth the truth but the queen waved
her hand peremptorily.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;No more, madam. It is our wish that he
attend us as he is. He shall don other garb
later.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
There was nothing left for Francis to do
but to follow her as she retired with the ladies
to the apartments which had been allotted to
her use. For the first time the girl was painfully
conscious of the incongruousness of her
attire. That the queen might ask her attendance
had not occurred to any of them, and
had it done so the affair would have seemed
easy of explanation, but it had been found
exceedingly difficult to get a hearing. She
resolved, however, that should occasion present
she would tell all hoping that the queen
would pardon the deception, if such it might
be called.

<i>ELIZABETH EXTENDED HER HAND GRACIOUSLY</i><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>
For some time Elizabeth conversed with
her maids, taking no notice of Francis, but at
length she said abruptly,
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Come here, my lad.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Francis approached diffidently, and, unused
to the customs of the court, remained standing.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Kneel, boy,&#8221; whispered one of the ladies
whom she afterward learned was the Duchess
of Rutland. &#8220;Where are thy manners?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Thy pardon,&#8221; murmured Francis in consternation
sinking upon one knee. &#8220;I knew
not. I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;There! &#8217;tis naught.&#8221; Elizabeth extended
her hand graciously, and the girl retained
presence of mind enough to kiss it respectfully.
&#8220;My good Rutland, expect not court
manners in the midst of a forest. The youth
means well enough, I dare say, and I liked
well his words of welcome. &#8217;Tis a pretty lad!
His tresses match our own for brightness.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Francis looked up somewhat indignantly.
Her locks were of red in truth, but they were
glossy and lustrous becoming golden in the
sun, while Elizabeth&#8217;s were a dull red and
false.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Oh, no, Your Majesty;&#8221; interposed one of
the ladies. &#8220;The lad&#8217;s hair is well enough,
but I should as soon think of likening a weed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
to a rose as of comparing such lack-lustre
locks to your liege&#8217;s.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Foolish girl!&#8221; chided Elizabeth though
a smile played about her lips for this great
queen did not object to the most fulsome flattery.
&#8220;To speak such words to me who am
an old woman. Now the lad, we dare affirm,
doth not think me so fair as his mother who
is, in truth, a beautiful woman. Speak, boy!&#8221;
She smiled at Francis as she spoke and rearranged
her draperies coquettishly.
</p>
<p>
Francis&#8217; young nature was filled with scorn
for the vanity of the woman before her, queen
though she was. Her mother&#8217;s face arose before
her with its delicate complexion guiltless
of the powder and the rouge affected by the
ladies of the court. Her tresses were streaked
somewhat with gray, but they were still her
own. Her eyes were as blue as periwinkles
and full of tenderness and love. The girl&#8217;s
eyes swept the painted face above her, and her
heart grew hot within her breast at the queen&#8217;s
question. Amazed at her own audacity she
arose and said boldly:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Madam, I crave pardon, but my mother
is to me the fairest woman in the world.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
</p>
<p>
For an instant there was dead silence in the
chamber. An expression of fury crossed the
queen&#8217;s face. She half rose from her couch,
and then sank back upon it.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;We were near forgetting, Sir Malapert, that
thou hadst not had benefit of court life.
Thy manners must be mended ere thou dost
come into our presence again. Go! you
weary me. Come near me no more. And he
is a pupil of Greville&#8217;s!&#8221; Francis heard her
exclaim as she hurried away. &#8220;My life, the
boy is duller than he looks!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Full of consternation at what she had done,
angry and resentful also, Francis sought her
parents to relate the incident to them.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Oh, child, child,&#8221; moaned the mother.
&#8220;What hast thou done! What hast thou
done!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My mother, was it not the truth? Thou
art fairer; a thousand times fairer than she.
She is an ugly old woman&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My daughter,&#8221; interrupted Lord Stafford,
&#8220;say no more. Elizabeth is the queen, and
whatever may be her weaknesses and faults
she is still the queen. And mark you, child!
though she hath many faults she hath also
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
great virtues. For this reason her people
overlook her vanity and exalt her. She is a
queen, but she is also a woman. Thou art
too young to understand all that that means
yet. Now, let me think how to make
amends.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;She said that I was to come near her no
more while she remained. I am sorry if I
did wrong in speaking so, but still it is the
truth. My mother is the fairer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Hush, hush,&#8221; whispered the lady drawing
her close. &#8220;&#8217;Tis treason, child. What doth
it matter to us whether or no I am the fairer.
It bodes us ill to say so. Oh, child, I am
afeared.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Let us ask Greville to aid us,&#8221; said Lord
Stafford. &#8220;Mayhap he can suggest a remedy,
for well doth he ken Elizabeth&#8217;s humors.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>AT THE QUEEN&#8217;S COMMAND</h3>
</div>

<p>
But neither Greville&#8217;s obsequious homage,
nor Lord and Lady Stafford&#8217;s apologies could
regain the goodwill of the queen. Seeing her
state of mind Lord Stafford advised that
Francis should retain her chamber during the
rest of Elizabeth&#8217;s visit.
</p>
<p>
For the three days that the queen remained
at the Hall her demeanor was such as to fill
its master with a vague uneasiness. Lady
Stafford she hardly tolerated, and though
Lord Stafford lavished gifts upon her, yet she
refused to be propitiated.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Surely,&#8221; Francis heard her father say to
her mother, &#8220;the remark of a child would
not suffice for such behavior? Elizabeth is
vain beyond most women, yet &#8217;twere doing
her an injustice to deem her capable of resentment
for so slight a thing. Can she have
learned of Ballard&#8217;s presence in England?
Of our visit to Chartley? And yet none save
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
we three knew whither we went. And you
would be discreet, I trow. Francis, young as
she is, would reveal naught that would do me
harm. She is too straightforward, too truthful,&#8221;&mdash;he
stopped with a light laugh and
kissed his wife. &#8220;What spirit the girl had to
tell the queen that thou wert fairer,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Thou art so in truth, Penelope, yet for my
life I durst not tell it to Elizabeth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay; I would not have thee to, my lord.
Say that Elizabeth is the loveliest, the fairest
of womankind, I care not so that I may keep
thee with me. But our child, my lord! I
fear for that very directness which thou dost
commend. A weaker spirit would be more
politic. I would not that she be less truthful,
but I wish, I wish&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay, sweetheart, wish not that she be
other than she is. I would not have her
fawning upon the queen as do the maids of
the court. Dost mark what words of flattery
they utter and yet with what ridicule they
speak of her to each other when they think
that there is none to hear? I would not that
Francis should be as they are.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nor I,&#8221; acquiesced the mother. &#8220;Yet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
sometimes truth doth not meet with the merit
it deserves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;True; but let us think not on that, but be
grateful that our child is as she is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Francis&#8217; heart glowed with love and tenderness
toward her parents, and she was grieved
that words of hers had brought such disquiet
upon them.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I must try,&#8221; she mused, &#8220;to retain my
truth and yet not offend by it. But how
could I have said other than I did? My
mother is fairer to me. There was but the
one answer to be given to such a question.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Over and over she turned the matter in her
mind striving to reconcile policy with truthfulness.
A problem which has vexed the
souls of men since the beginning of time.
</p>
<p>
At last the queen took her departure. As
she bade her host and hostess farewell, she
said:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Madam, I thank you for your entertainment.
My lord, though thou bearest me no
good will, yet shalt thou find that Elizabeth
doth not forget that thy father was the friend
of her father. &#8217;Tis pity that more attention
hath not been given to thy son&#8217;s manners, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
the fault shall be amended, I promise you.
England surely hath schools for its youth that
are equal to those of thy faith abroad.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Madam, what mean you?&#8221; asked the
nobleman detecting the menace in her words.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;We shall see what we shall see,&#8221; was the
queen&#8217;s enigmatical rejoinder. She swept to
her chariot, and with her brilliant train, soon
left Stafford Hall behind.
</p>
<p>
As the days glided by, and no sign or message
came from her, the anxiety engendered
by her last words faded away, and once more
a feeling of security crept into their hearts.
This false confidence was dispelled however
one warm day in July when a messenger from
the queen rode into the courtyard, and demanded
an audience with the master of the
Hall. The guest had been but a short time in
the presence chamber when Lord Stafford
emerged from the apartment with pale face.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Bid my lady and my daughter repair
hither without delay,&#8221; he cried hailing a
servitor.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;But, my lord,&#8221; Francis heard him say as
they hastened to the room in answer to the
summons, &#8220;I do but speak the truth when I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
declare that, as I live by bread, I have no
son. I have but one child, and that a daughter.
She is here to speak for herself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;What is it, father?&#8221; asked Francis going
to him, while Lord Shrope, the queen&#8217;s messenger,
looked his bewilderment.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;The queen hath commanded that my son,
Francis Stafford, shall accompany my Lord
Shrope to the court to become one of her pensioners.
He doubts my word when I say that
I have no son.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay, my lord; I must believe you if you
say that you have none,&#8221; said the nobleman
courteously. &#8220;But there is misapprehension
somewhere. If I do not misreckon foully the
queen spoke of both seeing and speaking with
him during her progress hither. There is
grave misunderstanding, I fear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Alas! my lord, this comes of deception,&#8221;
Lord Stafford despairing cried. &#8220;Let me unfold
to thee all that chanced during Her
Majesty&#8217;s stay, and do you advise me what
course to pursue for I am nigh bereft of wit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Let me hear all, Stafford,&#8221; returned the
other. &#8220;Thou knowest that I bear a heart
well disposed toward thee, and will gladly do
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
aught that will aid thee. Full well do I remember
how thou and I did consort together
at the court, and there hath been none to take
thy place since thou didst go into retirement
upon thy marriage. Therefore, say on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I thank thee that thou hast spoken so favorably
and kindly of the friendship that once
held between us,&#8221; replied Lord Stafford. &#8220;Albeit,
I would not curry favor with thee
because of it. But to the matter in hand.
Know then that when the Queen&#8217;s Majesty
was about to come hither, and we were preparing
for her reception, Hugh Greville, my
daughter&#8217;s tutor and my kinsman, did lament
that I had no son to speak the welcome to
Elizabeth. In an idle moment, I unwittingly
consented that Francis should don the habit
of a page and deliver the speech not thinking
that the queen would do more than to listen
to it. But she was drawn to the girl and
spoke words of approbation to her, enquiring
her name. &#8216;Francis,&#8217; she observed as the
child gave it her, &#8216;ah! well do I ken, my
lord, that that was your father&#8217;s name.&#8217; Then
as she moved on she asked if I had other
children. To which I answered, &#8216;No.&#8217; Methought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
that that would end the matter, but
mark you! She bade my supposed son to attend
her in her chamber; and then, thou
knowest the tenor of the court talk, she asked
if she did not deem her mother fairer than
she, the queen, was. My daughter, Shrope,
knows naught but to speak the truth. She is
a maiden of tender years, simply brought up,
and as wild and free as the linnet that sings
upon yon bough. She spoke the truth when
she answered that to her, her mother was the
fairest woman that lived. Elizabeth spurned
her from her presence, and conveyed threat as
to the manners of my son when she left the
hall. &#8217;Ods life, my lord! to what pass hath
England come when children must be taught
to dissemble and fawn else they be subjected
to discipline by the queen? Had she not
enough courtiers to hail her as &#8216;Diana,&#8217; and
&#8216;The Miracle of Time,&#8217; and other things of
like ilk that she must needs try to subvert my
child from truth? Gramercy! I am ready at
this moment to enter the tilt-yard to defend
the girl&#8217;s saying against all comers. Her
mother is the fairest lady that ere the sun
shone on. I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Hold, Stafford, thou ravest! Be not so
heated in thy words. Give pause while I
think on what thou hast told me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Lord Stafford tried to subdue his feelings
while the other sat in thought. Presently
Lord Shrope looked up.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Stafford, for the sake of that old friendship
to which I have before referred, bear
with me for what I am about to say. Rumor
hath whispered that thou hast given entertainment
to Jesuits which, as thou knowest, is
felony. Nay;&#8221; as Lord Stafford was about
to speak, &#8220;I would not ask thee if it be true
or no. But for that cause do I say, let the
girl assume once more her male attire and go
with me to the court. Elizabeth likes not
to be made the victim of a hoax, but there
are times when none enjoys a jest more than
she. When the time is propitious, I and
other of thy friends, will disclose the matter
to the queen. Believe me when I say that it
will be best so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Let Francis go from me to that court?&#8221;
cried the father in agonized tones. &#8220;I cannot!
I will not! She shall not stir from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
here! I will go to the queen and lay the
whole affair before her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Do not so, my lord. There are those who
have the queen&#8217;s ear who have whispered
against thee. Stafford Hall hath broad lands
in its demesne, and covetous eyes have been
cast upon it. &#8217;Twould be a choice morsel for
some favorite. &#8217;Twould not be wise for thee
to appear at court just now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Father,&#8221; said Francis, &#8220;why should I
not do as thy friend advises? I would not
that aught of harm should come to thee,
and surely none can come to me? Let me
go. It will be but a short time until my return,
because I feel certain that when the
queen learns that there was naught of intent
to deceive she will pardon all. Once, my father,
thou didst say that she was a queen but
still a woman. A woman, my father, with a
woman&#8217;s heart and a woman&#8217;s compassion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;A woman, yes; with a woman&#8217;s vanity,
and a woman&#8217;s spite,&#8221; broke from Lord Stafford.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Stafford, Stafford, it is well for thee that
none other hears thee. Thy daughter hath
well said that Elizabeth is a woman. Lion-hearted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
as well becomes a Tudor, but properly
appealed to, sympathetic and generous. Be
guided in this by me, my lord, and let her go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Yes, my father,&#8221; pleaded Francis.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;It shall be as her mother says,&#8221; said Lord
Stafford turning to his wife who had stood as
if stricken since hearing the advice of Lord
Shrope. &#8220;Speak, my wife. Shall we keep
our daughter, and defy Elizabeth&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Oh, no, no!&#8221; sobbed Lady Stafford. &#8220;I
am loath to let her go, and yet I would not
have her stay if by so doing we shall seem to
defy the queen. My lord, surely harm could
not come to the child, while for thee, I fear,
I fear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Then I may go.&#8221; Francis sprang to her
mother and embraced her. &#8220;Oh, &#8217;tis only for
my father that we need to fear. Naught of
harm will I come to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Upon mine honor, Stafford,&#8221; said Lord
Shrope going to Lord Stafford who had bowed
his head upon his hands, &#8220;even as I have
two lady birds of daughters of mine own, so
will I look after thine. Take heart, old
friend. I believe that all will be well else I
would not advise this step. Courage!&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>THE FAVOR OF PRINCES</h3>
</div>

<p>
The Bow bells were ringing as Francis and
her escort, Lord Shrope, drew near the city
of London three days later. It was sunset
and the silvery peal of the bells was clearly
borne to them upon the evening breeze.
Merrily they rang. Now wild and free; now
loud and deep; now slower and more slow
until they seemed to knell the requiem of the
day.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;How beautiful!&#8221; exclaimed Francis involuntarily
drawing rein. &#8220;Pause, I pray you,
my lord. Do they always ring so?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Ay, child. Ever since and long before
they sounded so musically in Dick Whittington&#8217;s
ears: &#8216;Turn again, turn again, thrice
lord mayor of London&#8217;! What think you
they say? Do they bear a message to your
ears?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The girl listened intently.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Methinks they say, &#8216;Come not to London,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
Francis! Come not to London town!&#8217; But
is there not in truth amidst all their toning
some melody or chant?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;There is, child, but not as thou hast so
fancifully thought a warning to thee. How
melodious is their chime! Think the rather
on that than on aught else.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Yes, my lord; and how wonderful is the
city! Marry! whatever betides I shall have
seen London!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
She sat erect as she spoke, and drank in
the scene with appreciative eyes. Lord
Shrope looked at Britain&#8217;s metropolis with
pride.
</p>
<p>
The last rays of the setting sun fell lingeringly
upon the great city. For great it was
though it numbered but one and thirty thousand
inhabitants at this time. Paris alone
excelled it in numbers. London, as the
representative of England in her supremacy
of the seas, her intellectual grandeur, and
above all as the friend of those who dared
to oppose the power of Rome, London stood
in the eyes of all men as the greatest city of
the world.
</p>
<p>
The towers and turrets that gleamed above
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
the strong walls that encircled the city; the
sure gates that gave entrance thereto; the
princely palaces with their large gardens, rich
porches and stately galleries; the open fields
that came up close to the walls; the distant
hills of Essex, Middlesex, Surrey and Kent
covered thickly with woods; the silvery
Thames, the silent highway of the Londoners,
its bosom covered by a forest of masts and
spanned by the great bridge,&mdash;even then old,&mdash;with
its gateways, towers, drawbridges,
houses, mills, chapel and wharfs; all these
went to make a picture that thrilled every
English heart.
</p>
<p>
The girl looked first this way and then
that as though she could never drink her
fill.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My lord,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;prithee tell me
which of all those turrets is the Tower?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;To the east, child. The white tower that
rises so majestically from the surrounding
turrets. Therein is written the whole history
of England. That is the lofty citadel which
it is said the great Julius himself raised.
And yonder lies Saint Paul&#8217;s. That sombre
and dungeon like stronghold is Baynard&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
castle. To our left is Westminster, and yon
beautiful palace is Whitehall. It is known
of all men how it reverted to the crown at
the fall of Wolsey. The queen&#8217;s father
adorned it in its present manner. There
stands Somerset house, and yonder is Crosby.
On the bankside in Southwark are the
theatres and Paris gardens where are the
bear pits. Look about thee, Francis. On
every building, almost on every stone is
writ the history of our forbears. On all
those walls are traces of Roman, Briton,
Anglo-Saxon and Norman. History in stone.
What sermons they might preach to us had
they but tongues!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;It is beautiful!&#8221; said Francis again.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;The bells have ceased their chiming,&#8221; said
Lord Shrope. &#8220;I would not break into thy
enjoyment, child, but we must hasten. Before
the darkness falls we must enter Greenwich
where Elizabeth is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
With a deep drawn sigh, Francis gave one
more look about her and then they passed
into the city.
</p>
<p>
Within the immediate vicinity of the
walls there were many gardens and open
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
spaces. The houses with their fanciful gables
and vanes, and tall twisted chimneys invited
and enchained the eye. The streets were
narrow, and alleys, courts and by-paths
abounded in every direction. While they
were at a distance they had heard only the
subdued noises of the city, above which the
bells sounded clearly. But now as they passed
through the streets their ears were assailed by
the cries of the pent-house keepers, or the
noises of the apprentices as they set upon
some offending pedestrian. The din was
almost indescribable. And yet in the midst
of the confusion there was music. From
every barber shop came the twang of cittern
or guitar, while song burst from the lips of
every tankard bearer.
</p>
<p>
All these, with other wonders, Francis encountered
as they wended their way through
alleys and byways until presently they came
to London Stone.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Now here will I dismount,&#8221; cried Francis
pleased and excited by all that she had seen
and heard.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;But why, child? We have not yet
reached the wharf where we take the wherry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
for Greenwich. Why should you pause
here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Because,&#8221; cried the girl with a laugh, &#8220;if
I cannot take possession of the city, I can at
least emulate that arch traitor, Jack Cade, and
strike my staff upon this stone.&#8221; So saying
she struck the ancient stone a sharp blow with
her whip.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Beshrew me, girl!&#8221; cried the nobleman
laughing, &#8220;thou shouldst in very truth have
been a boy! Marry! who but a lad would
have thought on such a thing! But hasten!
The last rays of yon setting sun must see us
at the palace.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Francis remounted her palfrey, and without
further incident they came to the wharf.
Leaving their horses in the charge of some
of the servitors of Lord Shrope they descended
the stairs that led through one of the numerous
water gates to the river, and entered one
of the wherries that lay clustered about waiting
for fares.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;See the barges,&#8221; cried the girl as they shot
London Bridge and passed down the river.
&#8220;How many there are!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The bosom of the river was covered over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
with barges, wherries and vessels of every description.
Busy as it was fleets of swans were
sailing upon its smooth surface, the noise of
their gabble mingling agreeably with the song
of the watermen.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Yes, many;&#8221; assented Lord Shrope in
answer to the girl&#8217;s remark, as retinues of
barges passed them, filled with many a freight
of brave men and beautiful women.
&#8220;Hearken, how the oarsmen keep time to
their oars.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Francis listened with delight as the song
of the wherrymen swelled in a mighty
chorus, for every boatman sang the same
thing:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Heave ho! rumbelow!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;And the swans,&#8221; she cried excitedly.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Yes; &#8217;tis a pleasant sight, and many have
wondered that they should stay upon the
river when it is so busy, but they are kindly
treated and no harm suffered to come to them.
Behold the dwellings of the nobles.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Nothing could have been more picturesque
at this time than the north bank of the
Thames with its broad gardens, lofty trees and
embattled turrets and pinnacles of the palaces,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
each of which had its landing-place and
private retinue of barges and wherries.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;This is the Tower,&#8221; said the nobleman as
they drew near that grim fortress. A low
browed projecting arch, above which was a
tower forming a striking part of the stronghold,
attracted the girl&#8217;s attention. Steps led
up from the river to a small ricket in the arch
which gave entrance into the Tower.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;That is the Traitors&#8217; Gate,&#8221; said Lord
Shrope. &#8220;Through that wicket pass all those
guilty of treason.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
A shudder passed over Francis as she gazed
at the forbidding portals.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Why dost thou shiver?&#8221; asked Lord
Shrope kindly, as he noticed her involuntary
tremor.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Sir,&#8221; answered Francis, in mournful tones,
&#8220;I fear that Tower. Something seems to
whisper me that yon grim walls and I will
become better acquainted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Now Heaven forfend!&#8221; ejaculated Lord
Shrope. &#8220;Thy doubts of thy reception at the
queen&#8217;s hands render thee fearful. Take
courage, child. All will yet be well. &#8217;Tis
not amiss that thou shouldst be doubtful, as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
the issue is uncertain. Were you but as the
queen thinks, and not in masquerade, you
would fare well at court. For &#8217;tis worthy the
ambition of any young man, be his rank of
the highest, or his prospects the most brilliant,
to become one of the queen&#8217;s pensioners. For
thus doth Her Majesty accomplish divers
things: she honoreth those who are such;
obligeth their kindred and alliance, and fortifieth
herself; for none can be brought near
her person without becoming willing to lay
down life itself in her behalf.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I should not be, were I in truth the boy
she thinks me,&#8221; declared Francis.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Subdue such spirit, girl,&#8221; rebuked he.
&#8220;The queen is graciousness itself to those
whom she favors, but frowardness and pertness
are not to her liking. In sooth, she tolerates
them not in those near her. For thy
father&#8217;s sake, have a care to thy words. The
slight disfavor under which thou dost labor
will soon be overcome, I doubt not, if thou
wilt show thyself submissive to her will. But
I mean not to chide thee, child, for I know
that thy maiden heart cannot but fail thee in
this hour. I would, an I could, turn thy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
mind to more of liking toward the queen else
will it be hard for thee to sue to her. Elizabeth
is a great ruler. The land hath never
before enjoyed so much of peace and prosperity.
Even her enemies cannot gainsay this
fact. But I fear that I weary thee, and thou
art troubled enough.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay, my lord; I know that thou dost
speak from the fulness of experience, and
therefore do thy words carry weight. I am
not weary but my heart doth fail me when I
think of the queen and the court. I am but
a maiden, my lord, unlearned in the ways
of courtiers, and should I fail to find favor
with the queen, who shall stand between me
and her will? Who is there who would brave
her displeasure to speak one word for me?
Marry! not one!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Think not on that aspect, girl, an thou
wouldst maintain thy spirit. He who would
achieve his end dwells not on failure. Think
on thy father. For his sake thou must get
the favor of the queen. For his sake so demean
thyself that all that he hath done will
be condoned. Mark thee, Francis! There
are those who whisper that he is the more inclined
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
to Mary of Scotland than to Elizabeth
of England. There lies his danger.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I thank you, my lord, for your words,&#8221;
said Francis. &#8220;Well will I heed them. Thou
hast been to me as a father in the discharge
of thy duty, though it must be irksome to
thee to be burdened with so troublesome a
charge. Nathless, I thank thee for thy words
and for thy care.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Her eyes filled with tears as she spoke and
she turned her head quickly that he might
not see them.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Thou art welcome to all that I have done,&#8221;
said Lord Shrope brusquely to hide his feelings
for he was filled with pity for the forlorn
state of the girl. &#8220;Troublesome thou hast
not been, but full of courage until now. How
now? Wilt thou play the girl when thou
dost wear that garb? Command thyself, I
pray, for we draw near the palace.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;&#8217;Tis true I wear this garb,&#8221; sobbed Francis,
&#8220;but yet I am a maiden, with a maiden&#8217;s
fears and a maiden&#8217;s weakness. Prithee bear
with me for a moment until I am myself
again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
She gave way to the emotion that overwhelmed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
her, for she was wearied by the
journey, excited over the new and strange
scenes of the past few days, and overwrought
with her fears. Lord Shrope bent a look of
compassion upon her, but uttered no word.
</p>
<p>
The song of the boatmen ceased as they
drew near the landing stairs of the palace.
There were numerous wherries waiting to unload
their human freight, and this gave Francis
time to recover her composure. So soon
as she was calm Lord Shrope motioned to the
watermen and they drew up at the stairs
which led to the great gate of the palace.
Courtyard and terrace were filled with gaily-dressed
ladies and nobles. Here a lady attended
by her gentlewomen traced her way
delicately, a gentleman-usher making way for
her, her train upheld by a page. Then gallants
ruffled along, their attire vying with
that of the ladies for brilliancy and richness.
Each courtier wore a rose behind his ear, and
upon his shoes were roses also to hide the
strings. Each bore a long sword upon one
side and a poniard on the other, and behind
him a body of serving men, proportioned to
his estate and quality, all of whom walked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
with the air of military retainers and were
armed with swords and bucklers. Laughing,
jesting and making merry, they seemed not to
have a care, though many a satin doublet and
silken vest concealed a heart as full of anxiety
as that of the girl who had just come
among them.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Beshrew me, my lord,&#8221; exclaimed a noble
in brave attire as Lord Shrope entered the
palace yard with his charge. &#8220;Art thou
come again? Methought I heard that wast
sent to France.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;And France is (Francis) here,&#8221; retorted
his lordship, indicating his companion.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Good! I&#8217; faith, very good, if Francis be
his name,&#8221; laughed the other. &#8220;A proper
lad, I trow. The queen hath ever an eye for
beauty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Where is Her Grace?&#8221; questioned Lord
Shrope.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;In the presence chamber,&#8221; was the reply.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Then let us hie thither,&#8221; spoke my lord,
and Francis hurried after him, confused and
embarrassed, as she encountered the curious
gaze of the courtiers and ladies. They passed
through the lofty halls and ante-chambers of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
the palace until at length they stood in the
long gallery at the upper end of which were
the folding doors that gave entrance to the
presence chamber.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Go not in, my lord,&#8221; pleaded the usher of
the black rod in charge of the door. &#8220;Something
hath gone amiss with Her Highness,
and the moment is not favorable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I thank you, Master Usher, but the queen
bade me seek her instantly upon my return,&#8221;
said Lord Shrope. &#8220;I needs must go to her
now. Come, Francis.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
So saying he boldly entered the chamber.
It was hung with magnificent tapestries toward
which Francis cast not so much as a
single glance, so intent was she upon the form
which seemed to dominate the room. At one
end of the apartment was a dais upon which
the queen sat under a royal canopy, surrounded
by her ministers and some courtiers.
They stood about with dismayed countenances
for the queen was in a rage. She looked up
as the two entered, and stared for a moment
as if seeking to know the meaning of their
entrance.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My liege sovereign,&#8221; cried Lord Shrope
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
without waiting for the Lord Chamberlain to
announce him, &#8220;I have come. Behold here
is the lad for whom you sent me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Out of my sight,&#8221; cried the queen angrily.
&#8220;&#8217;Ods death! is there none to keep the door
that every minion that lists may enter? Out
of my sight, and plague me not with a sight
of that boy. Away, varlet!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
With crestfallen visage Lord Shrope arose,
bowed profoundly and hurried Francis out of
the chamber.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I should have heeded thy warning, sir,&#8221;
he said to the usher. &#8220;Now I cannot seek
the queen until she bids me to her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;What shall I do?&#8221; asked the girl almost
in tears. &#8220;Whither shall I go?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Thou shalt come with me, my child. My
lady wife will look to thy comfort. There
shalt thou abide until it shall be safe to approach
Elizabeth. Thy star is not in the
ascendant.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;And I have involved thee too in Her
Grace&#8217;s displeasure,&#8221; said Francis with contrition.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay; Elizabeth is too just to harbor ill
toward me who hath but wrought her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
pleasure. Though verily the humors of
princes like their favors are uncertain. But
come!&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>A FAMILIAR FACE AND A CHALLENGE</h3>
</div>

<p>
Lady Shrope received the girl with kindness
but her anxiety, when her husband recounted
the manner of his reception by the
queen, was great.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Thou hast no cause for fear,&#8221; remarked
Lord Shrope. &#8220;Elizabeth is the very muster
of justice and honor. When she hath suffered
a few hours to pass she will repent her
of her injustice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The nobleman was right. At an early hour
the next day he was summoned to the presence
of the queen, and bade to bring his
charge with him.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I cry your pardon, my lord,&#8221; said Elizabeth
extending her hand to him graciously.
&#8220;Thine entrance yester e&#8217;en was ill-timed.
We had received tidings that ruffled our royal
dignity and permitted us to treat thee with
undue rigor. Dost forgive thy queen, my
lord?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;There is naught I would not forgive
Elizabeth,&#8221; returned he with earnestness.
&#8220;Had I known I would have delayed seeking
an audience but methought it was your wish
that I should come to you upon my first arrival.
Forgive me that I did misinterpret
your desire.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;If thou hast forgiven me then do I forgive
thee,&#8221; said the queen. &#8220;Rise, my lord,
and I will speak of this boy, and then to
other matters. Business of state awaits the
morning hours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;He is here, my liege, to speak for himself,&#8221;
answered he, and beckoned Francis to
come forward.
</p>
<p>
She did so diffidently and kneeled before
the queen.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay; I wish not to speak with him, my
lord,&#8221; and <a name="fran1" id="fran1"></a><ins class="trnote" title="Transcriber&#8217;s Note: Frances in original text">Francis</ins> noted with dismay that
she did not extend her hand to her. &#8220;Let
him take his place with the pages. They will
soon let him into the manners of the court, I
trow. When he shall have rubbed off some
of the rustic mayhap I will have something
to say to him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My liege,&#8221; ventured the nobleman, &#8220;will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
you listen to something concerning the lad
which &#8217;tis best that you should know?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Now, by my faith, my lord! thou dost
try our patience,&#8221; said Elizabeth sharply.
&#8220;Said we not that affairs of state awaited us.
We go at once to the council chamber. My
lord chamberlain,&#8221; turning to that official
whose white staff indicated his office, &#8220;place
this lad where his manners will meet with
the most improvement.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
She swept out of the room followed by her
ministers, while the courtiers and ladies dispersed
according to their fancy.
</p>
<p>
Francis had remained in a kneeling posture
all this time scarcely able to control her tears.
A tap on the shoulder aroused her, and looking
up she saw the kindly face of Lord
Hunsdon, the lord chamberlain, bending
over her.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Be not disheartened, boy,&#8221; he said compassionately.
&#8220;The tide will turn, and thou
wilt soon be swept upon the flood into the
sunshine of Her Majesty&#8217;s regard. Come, and
I will show thee those who are to be thy fellow
companions.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My lord chamberlain,&#8221; said Lord Shrope
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
hurriedly, &#8220;out of the goodness of your
heart, permit me one word. The lad is unacquainted
with the court, and unused to the
society of pages whom as thou knowest, albeit
their outward &#8217;havior conforms to
custom, yet still are ofttimes unmannerly in
their demeanor to each other. For that reason,
and for the love which once I did bear
his father, I entreat you, let the lad remain
with me. I will see to&#8217;t that his deportment
is all that could be asked.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My lord, I dare not,&#8221; was the chamberlain&#8217;s
reply. &#8220;Thou knowest that where the queen
commands she exacts obedience to her behests.
He must go with the pages.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My lord, a word in your ear. The lad is
not as he seems.&#8221; And Lord Shrope rapidly
explained the matter.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Ha! sayst thou so?&#8221; explained Lord
Hunsdon regarding Francis earnestly. &#8220;By
my halidom, my lord, there is none who
would take her to be other than she appears.
Somewhat delicate looking, forsooth, but
there are many lads as maiden-like. If the
matter be given to the queen in proper manner
she will regard it with lenient eyes, but if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
not, she may treat it as deceit practised upon
herself. That she would not forgive.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;True;&#8221; assented Lord Shrope. &#8220;&#8217;Tis
that aspect of the affair that troubles me.
Thou seest that for this cause I would that
the girl might remain with my lady wife.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;It may not be,&#8221; said the chamberlain.
&#8220;Let the girl be in attendance with the pages
in accordance with the queen&#8217;s command
until she learns of the child&#8217;s sex, which, for
the damsel&#8217;s sake, I would discover soon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I thank you, my lord, for your kindness,&#8221;
returned Lord Shrope. &#8220;It is my desire also
that the queen should learn of the affair at
an early season. But the time must be
propitious.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Yes; the time must be propitious.&#8221; The
lord chamberlain turned to <a name="fran2" id="fran2"></a><ins class="trnote" title="Transcriber&#8217;s Note: Frances in original text">Francis</ins> who had
listened to the above conversation with blushing
cheeks. &#8220;It seems best, my child, to
carry out the queen&#8217;s command at least in
part. Canst thou so bear thyself that none
will be the wiser of thy sex? The discipline
of the palace is strict and the pages observe
punctiliously the outward forms of respect.
Still the minions do ofttimes o&#8217;erstep the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
bounds and indulge in rare pranks. Methinks
&#8217;twould be wise for them to know naught of
thy disguise. The knaves are as full of mischief
as sprites.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I fear them not,&#8221; said Francis spiritedly.
&#8220;I fear naught but the queen&#8217;s displeasure.
For any other, I care not who he be, woe to
him who dares touch Francis Stafford.&#8221; She
touched the poniard that dangled from her
belt significantly as she spoke.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Child,&#8221; cried the old lord in delight,
&#8220;thou wearest the proper garb. Thou wast
never meant for a girl. Zounds! what spirit!
And so thou fearest naught in all England
but the displeasure of the queen. Gramercy!
the air of the court is beginning to tell upon
thee for those are the words of a courtier.
Come! I no longer fear for thee so long as
thou dost continue to bear thyself in so fearless
a manner.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I bid you farewell, my lord,&#8221; said Francis
to Lord Shrope.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Farewell for a season, my child. Return
to my lady when thy duties are ended,&#8221; said
her friend. &#8220;Lighter will my heart be when
thou art once more in thy father&#8217;s house.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
Marry! I would that I had not advised bringing
thee thither. Now I know not what may
befall.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Chide not thyself, my lord,&#8221; returned
Francis who had recovered her natural courage
now that the interview with the
queen was over. &#8220;All will be well in a few
days, I doubt not. Meantime, it suits me
well that I am to see somewhat of the
court.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Marry! it suits not me,&#8221; returned his
lordship bluntly. &#8220;I like not to see a wild
bird caged. The linnet is never so sweet as
in its own woodland.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;But the hawk flies as high for its keeper
as when seeking its own quarry,&#8221; said Francis
as she moved away. &#8220;Again, my lord, farewell
until the eventide.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Farewell. Be discreet, child.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Francis followed Lord Hunsdon through
several lofty halls and chambers. Finally
the official caught sight of a youth who stood
idly by a pillar.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Devereaux,&#8221; he called. &#8220;I would speak
with thee.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I am here, my lord.&#8221; The boy was at his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
side instantly. &#8220;Command me, I pray you.
How can I serve you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Take this lad, and make him thy pupil,
Edward. He hath been sent here to be
taught manners. There be none so well
versed in such things as thou art. Therefore
do I give him into thy charge.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The youth raised his head and gave a keen
searching glance at Francis. The recognition
was instantaneous. Francis gave a slight
exclamation for the boy was he with whom
she had contested the slaying of the deer.
Beyond a slight sparkle of his eye the lad
betrayed no sign of ever having seen her
before.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;And, Edward, I know the custom that
prevails amongst the pages of treating with
undue harshness such as come among ye for
the first time. I charge you, as you wish to
curry favor with me, that this lad shall meet
with naught but gentleness. Dost hear,
Edward?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Ay, my lord. It shall be as thou sayst.
He shall be treated with gentleness. With
exceeding great gentleness, I promise you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The boy&#8217;s manner was very deferential, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
the ears of Francis caught the sinister meaning
that lurked beneath his words.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My lord,&#8221; she said boldly, &#8220;is there none
other to whom I may be consigned except
this youth? I like not his appearance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Like not Edward?&#8221; exclaimed Lord
Hunsdon in surprise. &#8220;Why, what caprice is
this? He is a proper lad, and there is no
other of the pages so trustworthy. Thou
shouldst deem thyself fortunate to be put
into his hands.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Marry, sir,&#8221; remarked Edward Devereaux
with a sorrowful air, &#8220;&#8217;tis pity that my visage
is so unattractive. If the boy is afeared,&#8221;
with a slight emphasis on the word, &#8220;you
would best place him with another. Fear
makes cowards of us all, and breeds distrust
of the most worthy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Gramercy,&#8221; cried the girl hotly, &#8220;dost
thou think that I fear thee, sirrah? Nay;
my lord, I will take none other for my
mentor than he. Mayhap while he imparts
to me the nice customs of the court, he will
in turn learn of me something he wots not
of. Marry! we each have much to learn.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Tut! is this the way to begin?&#8221; said his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
lordship impatiently. &#8220;Edward, I shall look
to thee for a good report of thy charge.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;It shall be well, sir,&#8221; returned Edward
Devereaux bowing profoundly. The chamberlain
left the two, and the boy faced the
girl. &#8220;So,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we are come to learn
manners, are we? By my faith, &#8217;tis time.
Thou dost discover too much heat, Master
Stafford, and that, thou shouldst know, is not
permitted at court. Take that for thy first
lesson.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I will take naught for my lesson from
thee,&#8221; said Francis quickly. &#8220;Who art thou
to teach manners to me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Hast never heard of Edward Devereaux?&#8221;
queried the lad. &#8220;Much hast thou missed
for he is before you,&#8221; and he bowed mockingly.
&#8220;Know, Francis Stafford, that thou and I
have a feud of long standing. Hast heard
thy father speak of Sir Thomas Devereaux of
Kent? I am his son, cousin german to
Robert Devereaux, Earl of Essex. Surely,
even if thou dost reside far from the court,
thou dost know that there hath always been
enmity between the Devereaux and the
Staffords?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Ay! I know of it,&#8221; assented Francis.
&#8220;And that is why thou didst claim, the deer
which was slain by my hand in the park?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;So thou dost still claim the deer? Mark
you, Francis Stafford! We of the court
think it not honorable to claim that which
doth not belong to us. Thou hadst no
shadow of hand in the deed. It lies between
thy sister and me. Yet still thou
sayst,&mdash;&#8216;I slew it.&#8217; Hark ye! if ye so choose
we can settle the matter in the great park
some eventide. But for the sake of truth
say no more that you slew it. It is between
thy sister and myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My sister,&#8221; murmured Francis, and then
remembering herself: &#8220;My sister be it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;And thou and I will meet and decide the
business once for all,&#8221; went on Devereaux.
&#8220;Come! what say you to the third night
from this? There are duties that forbid the
undertaking sooner.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;But, but,&#8221; stammered Francis. &#8220;I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Ah! thou dost fear.&#8221; Edward Devereaux
looked his scorn. &#8220;We will drop the matter.
But thou must fight, or concede that I slew
the deer.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I fear nothing,&#8221; cried the girl. &#8220;I will
meet thee when and where thou wilt.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Then on the third night from this, thou
and I will meet in the park close by the
wicket of the western gate. I will show thee
this day where it lieth. And now we must to
duty.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>A STRANGE DUEL</h3>
</div>

<p>
Now, Francis Stafford knew but little of the
noble art of fencing. Once or twice her
father had given her the foils and shown her
some of the attitudes and thrusts, but beyond
that her knowledge did not extend. It was
with considerable trepidation, therefore, that
she thought of the approaching combat.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Marry!&#8221; she mused. &#8220;Were it not that
Master Devereaux would impute it to fear I
would not engage in such contest. It is not
befitting my maiden dignity, and I know my
mother would not approve. Yet there have
been maiden warriors, why should there not
be maiden duelists. I doubt not, were the
truth known, that there have been many.
But howsoe&#8217;er that may be, my father, I know,
would not like me to submit to the implication
of fear; albeit I would not harm the lad
even though he be the son of my father&#8217;s
enemy.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
</p>
<p>
Through the watches of the night the question
of swordsmanship troubled her, and when
the morning came she had reached no solution
of the difficulty.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I dare not appeal to any who know my
sex,&#8221; she thought as she took her place among
the pages that swarmed one of the ante-chambers.
&#8220;I would that I knew of one that
would teach me to thrust and to parry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
While she was thus musing a courtier approached
her. He was gorgeously arrayed.
Jewels to a fabulous amount adorned his person.
Even upon his pantoufles or shoes were
large pearls instead of the roses beloved of the
gallants. His beard was pointed, his eyes set
close together; his manner, when he chose,
was irresistible, and his smile very winning.
There was a pipe of the new found tobacco in
his mouth,&mdash;a weed that had just been imported
from the new world.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My fair lad,&#8221; said the courtier removing
his pipe, and speaking in the broad soft accent
of Devonshire, &#8220;I have not marked thy face
before. Art new to the court?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Yes, my lord,&#8221; answered Francis noting
with delight the accent. &#8220;I am Francis Stafford
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
from Hampshire, but newly arrived at
the court. But thou, thou art from Devon, I
am sure. It is my mother&#8217;s native heath.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;True, boy; I am from Devon. Sayst thou
that thy mother is from that shire? Then
thou and I should be good friends. Bethink
you! Could you play Hermes for me
to one of the maids of honor?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I could, my lord. But prithee tell me
whom I serve?&#8221; and the girl looked eagerly
into his face.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I am Walter Raleigh,&#8221; answered he.
&#8220;This weed hath given me somewhat of
fame.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay;&#8221; said Francis quickly. &#8220;Not the
weed but thine own achievements.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;By my faith, thou art as silvery tongued
as Orpheus with his lute,&#8221; said Sir Walter
with a smile. &#8220;Mark me, boy! I would not
that any should know of this message, least
of all the queen. &#8217;Tis not that there is aught
of harm in it, lad. As thou art new to the
court thou mayest not know that it is not permitted
to any to deem any fair save the queen,
and so we are sometimes forced to send tokens
sub rosa.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I know, Sir Walter,&#8221; said Francis sadly.
&#8220;&#8217;Tis for that very self-same cause that I am
here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Then, lad, we understand each other.
Know you Mistress Elizabeth Throckmorton,
one of the queen&#8217;s maids?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay; &#8217;tis but my second day in the palace,&#8221;
replied Francis.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Then must I show her to thee,&#8221; said Sir
Walter. &#8220;As Her Majesty goes to take the air
upon the river to-day I will linger a little behind.
When the maids of honor come forth,
mark well my action. As they pass I will
drop my glove at the feet of her who is Elizabeth
Throckmorton.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I will note thy action, Sir Walter, and
give to the lady thy token in such manner
that none save the fair one herself shall be the
wiser.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Good, my lad! Thou art a true Hermes.
As gracious in thy service as was ever that
messenger of the gods. Thou wilt make me
thy debtor a thousandfold. What guerdon
dost thou wish?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay, Sir Walter; I want nothing. &#8217;Tis
pleasing to me to be of service to thee.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Why, boy, &#8217;tis the custom of the court to
take all that one can get,&#8221; cried Sir Walter
who was noted for that very thing. &#8220;Hast
thou no favor to ask? No desire of thine inmost
heart?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Oh,&#8221; cried the girl as a thought darted
into her mind, looking at him timidly, &#8220;if I
might be beholden to you for one favor. If
thou wouldst, Sir Walter&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she paused.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Speak on, lad,&#8221; said Raleigh kindly.
&#8220;Thou are not the first to prefer request for
service. In truth thou wouldst be a rara
avis shouldst thou not demand something.
There lives no man, nor woman, nor child at
the court who hath not his own end to
further. Therefore speak and say what I
shall give thee.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Sir Walter,&#8221; said Francis emboldened by
his words, &#8220;thou art a great swordsman and
noted for thy skill in the use of that weapon.
Impart to me that knowledge, I beseech you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Is that thy wish?&#8221; cried Sir Walter in
amazement. &#8220;Right willingly will I teach
thee, for I perceive that thou art a lad of
parts. &#8217;Tis an art that is more excellent than
any other military exercise, because there is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
very great and general use thereof. Not only
in general wars, but also in particular combats.
Seek me anon, and I will soon make
thee a master of the sword.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
With a dazzling smile he left her. Francis
repaired to the courtyard to await the coming
of the queen and her maidens.
</p>
<p>
The royal barge, manned by watermen attired
in regal liveries, lay at the foot of the great
stairs which ascended from the river. The
yeomen of the guard in scarlet jerkins with
halberds in their hands, guarded the passage
from the palace to the waterside. Presently
the ushers issued from the mansion, flanked
by a band of gentlemen pensioners. After
this, amidst a crowd of ladies and gentlemen,
came Elizabeth herself.
</p>
<p>
Sir Walter Raleigh walked by the queen,
but, as if pushed back from his position by
the press of people who crowded to see her,
he dropped slightly to the rear. As the ladies
went gaily by, laughing and talking, he let
fall his gauntlet just in front of a beautiful
girl. Recovering the glove as Elizabeth
looked about inquiringly for him he resumed
his place by her side. He was in high favor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
at this time, and consequently obliged to be
in constant attendance upon her.
</p>
<p>
Francis looked attentively at the lady so
indicated and followed the maids as unobtrusively
as possible to the boats. The young
ladies of honor were to be in a boat by themselves
with two older ladies for chaperons.
As soon as the girl perceived this she pushed
forward boldly, and, with true page-like
officiousness, <a name="proffered" id="proffered"></a><ins class="trnote" title="Transcriber&#8217;s Note: profered in original text">proffered</ins> her services to the
beautiful Elizabeth Throckmorton.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I have a page of mine own in attendance,
young sir,&#8221; said the lady with a smile. &#8220;Nathless
I thank you for your courtesy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Fair lady,&#8221; said Francis in a low tone,
&#8220;hast ever heard of Hermes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;He was the messenger of the gods, sir,&#8221;
returned she in surprise. &#8220;Why?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Because I am he,&#8221; returned the supposed
page with a bow. &#8220;Albeit I come not from
the gods. &#8217;Twas Eros who sent me, therefore,
I beseech you to permit me to hand you to
the boat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
With a laugh and a deep blush Mistress
Throckmorton extended her hand, and
Francis led her to the barge, leaving the missive
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
of Sir Walter in the maiden&#8217;s soft
palm.
</p>
<p>
Later in the day, receiving a summons from
Raleigh she hastened to him and reported the
success of her mission. &#8220;Gramercy, boy!
thou wert most gallant in the delivery,&#8221;
laughed Sir Walter. &#8220;And now for thy first
lesson with the sword.&#8221; And soon the two
were deep in the mysteries of fencing.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Every man should be master of this
weapon,&#8221; declared the sailor when Francis,
exhausted by the swift play of the blades,
sank down for a few moments&#8217; rest. &#8220;Even
though one be small of stature and weak of
strength, dexterity with the sword may make
him master of a much larger adversary. I
could tell thee tales, lad, as would make thy
hair to rise of the way I have seen the sword
used. Have to, boy! I have but little more
time to give thee. Thou art an apt scholar!
So! that was a good parry. A little removing
of the foot, a sudden turning of the hands,
a slight declining of the body, and thine opponent
is at thy mercy. So, lad, so!&#8221;
</p>

</div>

<p>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
</p>
<p>
The fencing lesson was repeated the next
day. Francis no longer dreaded the meeting
with Edward Devereaux, and when the night
fell, she stole away to the dueling place confident
that she would be the victor in the
affair.
</p>
<p>
There was no one at the wicket of the western
gate, and she sat down to await the coming
of her adversary with impatience. The
broad yellow beams of the full moon lighted
up the open spaces of the park with a brightness
as if the sun had just set while the shadows
under the trees were darker and heavier
by contrast. Numerous statues gleamed in
the pale light like ghosts newly risen from
their sepulchres. Fountains threw jets of
water into the air, caught the moonbeams,
and fell again into their basins in showers of
molten silver. A light breeze ruffled the
leaves and came with refreshing coolness after
the sultriness of the day. All was still save
for the music of the night bird of song. The
beauty of the scene, the melody of the nightingales,
oppressed Francis with a sense of
melancholy.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Am I doing aright,&#8221; she said aloud.
&#8220;Surely I could do naught else unless I betrayed
my sex. Now the matter hath gone
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
so far that I must bear myself as if I were in
sooth a boy. But I will not kill the lad.
Only make him acknowledge my skill with
the deer. I would that he would come. I
know not why, but I feel my courage departing
from me in the loneliness of the night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
At this instant, as if in answer to her wish,
there was the sound of hurried footsteps, and
soon the form of Edward Devereaux appeared
among the trees.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I crave thy pardon, Master Stafford,&#8221; he
cried, &#8220;if I have kept thee waiting. Sir
Christopher Hatton detained me, and I could
not come sooner. Draw and defend thyself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
He drew his own sword as he spoke and
threw himself on guard. Without one word
of reply Francis placed herself on the defensive.
And then began a curious scene.
Parry, thrust and parry&mdash;the steel rattled,
and the strange duel was on. The nightingales
ceased their singing as if amazed at the
folly of the human things. The only sound
that fell upon the air besides the clash of the
blades was the labored breathing of the
contestants. Francis&#8217; new-found knowledge
stood her well in hand, and she pressed her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
opponent furiously. Suddenly she made a
false step&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;A hit! a hit!&#8221; cried Edward Devereaux.
</p>
<p>
As the rapier entered her right arm the
weakness of her sex overcame the girl. She
uttered a faint cry, and, for the first time in
her life, fell in a dead faint.

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>THE STRANGE WEAKNESS OF FRANCIS STAFFORD</h3>
</div>

<p>
When Francis recovered consciousness she
found Edward Devereaux bending over her
with the utmost concern.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;You live,&#8221; he cried joyfully as she opened
her eyes. &#8220;Now Heaven be praised! Methought
that I had killed thee, Master
Stafford.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Methought that it was to be a tilt a l&#8217;outrance,&#8221;
said Francis trying to rise. &#8220;Oh,&#8221;
she moaned sinking back as dizziness again
assailed her. &#8220;I know not why but I am so
weak. Bethink you that I am dying, Master
Devereaux?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I understand it not,&#8221; returned the lad
much perturbed. &#8220;The wound is naught.
See! I slashed the sleeve of thy doublet and
examined it. The cut should tingle and
smart as all such do when green, but there is
naught in it that should cause thy death.
Art thou still no better?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay;&#8221; said Francis feebly. &#8220;I am sure
that my time is come. Good Edward, I beseech
you, bring me a priest that he may
shrive me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;There is no priest in all the castle walls,
Francis Stafford. Know you not that priests
and all such popery are forbid? I will call a
chirurgeon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay; do not so,&#8221; said the girl. &#8220;What
this weakness that has o&#8217;ertaken me may be, I
know not, unless it be death. E&#8217;er I depart
I would assoil my soul of all taint. Therefore
incline thine ear, Master Devereaux, and
receive my confession. It cuts me to the
quick to make acknowledgment, but I have
hated thee because thy skill with the bow was
greater than mine.&#8221; She paused for a moment.
It was hard for Francis Stafford to
confess fault even though she believed herself
to be dying. Soon she continued: &#8220;It was
thine arrow, Edward Devereaux, that slew
the deer. I knew it at the time, but I liked
not to own thy skill. Wilt thou pardon me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Gladly, gladly,&#8221; said Devereaux. &#8220;Only
I know not how thou couldst have seen the
arrow. Thou wert not there.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I was, Edward,&#8221; returned Francis. &#8220;I
am in truth Francis Stafford, but I am
the daughter instead of the son of my
father.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Thou!&mdash;A girl!&#8221; The youth drew back
in astonishment. &#8220;And I struck thee with
my sword? O chivalry! I am undone! I
am undone!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay; take it not so to heart. The blame
is not thine. How couldst thou know that I
was other than I seemed?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;But I struck thee!&#8221; The boy seemed almost
stunned. &#8220;Would Sidney have been
guilty of such an act? Would the basest
hind in the field have lifted a sword against
a woman? Fair mistress,&#8221; he cried in distress
offering his sword to her, &#8220;do one last
favor for Edward Devereaux. Bury that
sword in the breast of him who is unworthy
to bear it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;In the name of St. George, what means
this?&#8221; cried Lord Shrope as he and Lord
Hunsdon ran out from among the trees.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;By my faith, my lord,&#8221; cried the chamberlain
bursting into a laugh. &#8220;If there has
not been a duel!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Art hurt, Francis?&#8221; and Lord Shrope
bent over the girl with solicitude.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My lord, methought just now that I was
dying, but the weakness that overcame me
hath departed,&#8221; and the girl staggered to her
feet with his assistance.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;But thou art wounded? Girl, girl, what
doth it mean?&#8221; Lord Shrope caught hold of
the sleeve that dangled from her bared arm.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Edward,&#8221; said the lord chamberlain
sternly, &#8220;I am surprised at thee. Is this thy
honor? Thou wert to treat this girl with
gentleness. I had thy word. Thou knowest
also that no brawling is permitted near the
person of the queen. It shall go hard with
thee for this. Francis Stafford might not
know the law, albeit ignorance excuses none,
but thou didst. Besides, in the name of
chivalry, what cause had you to draw your
sword against a maiden?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My lord,&#8221; said Devereaux who had received
the rebuke with bowed head, &#8220;deal
with me as you list. There is no penalty too
severe to be visited upon me. There is
naught that can restore self-esteem to Edward
Devereaux. But, I beseech you, believe me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
when I say that I knew not until now that
yon maiden was a boy only in attire. My
lord, believe this, and you may do with me
as you will.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;&#8217;Tis true,&#8221; corroborated Francis. &#8220;He is
no more at fault for the encounter than I, my
lord. And he knew not that I was not a
boy, until, thinking that my end was near, I
told him. I know not why I felt so
weak.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Thou didst swoon, child,&#8221; said Lord
Shrope. &#8220;&#8217;Tis a matter that is of frequent
occurrence among thy sex. Didst never experience
it before?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Never,&#8221; replied Francis with a light
laugh. Save for the sting and smart of the
wound she was fully herself. &#8220;And I like it
not. I&#8217; faith, were I to have them often,
there would be few sins of Francis Stafford&#8217;s
that would be unknown.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Didst confess to Edward?&#8221; laughed Lord
Shrope. &#8220;You two should be great friends
anent this.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;No;&#8221; said Francis. &#8220;I confessed that he
killed the deer, and that its horns were justly
his. I will not retract that, but still do I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
count him mine enemy, even as his father
and mine are at feud.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;So be it,&#8221; said Edward Devereaux mournfully.
&#8220;Thou canst not, maiden, hate me
more than I loathe myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Come, Francis,&#8221; said Lord Shrope, &#8220;we
must to my lady. We were filled with alarm
when thou didst not come at the usual hour,
and my lord and I have sought for thee
everywhere. It was lucky chance that
brought us this way. Child, child, I would
that thy father had thee with him, or else
were here. I would also that the queen were
not so obdurate in her mind against thee.
But she will not have thy name broached
to her. Something lies underneath it all.
Hadst thou been concerned in treasonous undertakings
the matter would be plain. As it
is&mdash;but why think of it? That wound of
thine which to a man would be a mere
scratch must with thee be looked to. Let us
away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The inconvenience caused by the hurt was
short, but, before the girl resumed her place
among the pages, Lord Shrope again ventured
to speak of her to the queen.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My liege,&#8221; he said one morning when the
queen had been particularly gracious to him,
&#8220;I would that you would let me speak of
Francis Stafford. There is somewhat&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Now a murrain on thee, Shrope, for
mentioning that name,&#8221; cried Elizabeth her
humor changing instantly. &#8220;We, too, have
somewhat to say of Francis Stafford, but the
time is not yet ripe. When it is, then will I
hear what thou hast to say. Until then we
would not be plagued with the matter.
Hearest thou?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I do, my sovereign mistress,&#8221; answered
Lord Shrope humbly. &#8220;I hear and will heed
thy commands. Only take not from me thy
divine favor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Hadst thou ever been connected with any
enterprise against her,&#8221; he said to Francis as
he reported the result of the interview, &#8220;I
could understand it. As it is, her mood
toward thee gives me great concern.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Trouble not thyself, my good friend,&#8221; answered
Francis, though she herself was more
disturbed than she cared to admit. Perhaps
the journey to Chartley had come to the
queen&#8217;s ears, and that enterprise wore a different
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
complexion now to the girl than it had
done ere her coming to the court. &#8220;Trouble
not about me. Thou canst do no more than
thou hast done.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
And so she went back to her place among
the pages. The greeting between her and
Edward Devereaux was formal. As the time
passed she became aware that the lad&#8217;s
manner toward her was quite different from
what it had been before their encounter.
Now he seemed to regard her with something
akin to admiration, and assumed a protecting
air toward her, assuming many of her duties,
that irked the girl exceedingly.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Prithee, sirrah,&#8221; she said one day pettishly
when his guardianship was more than usually
apparent, &#8220;who gave thee leave to watch
over me? It irks me to have thee play the
protector. Beshrew me, but Francis Stafford
can care for herself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I crave pardon, Master Stafford,&#8221; replied
Devereaux who never by word or deed
dropped a hint that he knew aught of her
sex. &#8220;I crave pardon if I have offended. I
will vex thee no more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
From that time his care was more unobtrusive,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
but Francis was still conscious of
it, and it was gall and wormwood to her.
She could not forget the acknowledgment of
his skill had been wrung from her when she
thought herself dying. Although she could
not but admit that Devereaux was innocent
in the matter, she felt as though a fraud had
been perpetrated upon her, and, girl-like,
held him responsible for it.
</p>
<p>
And so life at the court went on. A great
family under the same walls, loving and
hating. The courtiers divided into factions;
their followers being kept from brawling only
by the presence of the queen. The serving
men followed the example of their betters
and squabbled in the kitchen; the butlers
drank on the sly in the cellars; the maids
chattered in the halls; the pages pilfered
from the buttery; the matrons busied in the
still rooms compounding fragrant decoctions
for perfumes, or bitter doses for medicine;
the stewards weighing money in the treasury;
gallants dueling in the orchard or meeting
their ladies on the stairs. But Francis liked
it all.
</p>
<p>
The gallant courtiers with their song and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
fence, and quibble and prattle and pun; the
gaily dressed ladies; the masques in the
great hall of the castle; the pomp and
ceremony that attended the queen when she
went abroad: all appealed to her æsthetic
nature.
</p>
<p>
She soon learned to distinguish the
courtiers. The Gipsy Earl of Leicester, with
his swarthy handsome face; the tall and
comely vice chamberlain, Sir Christopher
Hatton; the venerable Burleigh; the trusty
and wily Walsingham; the gay, witty and
sarcastic Harrington, godson of the queen,
and the fiery and impetuous Earl of Essex,
stepson to Leicester.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes a low, broad-shouldered, heavily-built
man would appear at court followed by
brawny sailors who bore great chests of gold
gathered from the Spanish Main. Then the
court would be filled with the deeds of Sir
Francis Drake, and of the wondrous happenings
in that new world which lay over the
sea.
</p>
<p>
Youth does not examine closely below the
surface, and so to the girl all was bright and
beautiful. She herself would have entered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
into the life more fully, but that the cloud of
the queen&#8217;s displeasure hung over her. There
is no place where a sense of the august disapprobation
makes itself so quickly felt as a
court. And, as the days went by and Elizabeth
still refused to permit her approach,
Francis found herself more and more isolated.
</p>
<p>
Even the courtiers who had formerly called
upon her to perform services for them now
chose other of the pages, while the pages themselves
no longer stopped to chat or gossip with
her.
</p>
<p>
Thus the days went by.

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>WHAT CAME OF AN OFFER OF FRIENDSHIP</h3>
</div>

<p>
One thing had puzzled Francis upon her
first arrival at the court. That was the number
of those who had red hair. She soon
came to know, however, that most of the ladies
wore wigs of false hair over their own
tresses out of compliment to the queen. The
demand for hair was therefore great, and frequently
the supply was not equal to it. Divers
means were employed to obtain such locks, as
the girl soon found to her sorrow.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Where art thou from, my pretty page?&#8221;
asked a lady one day pausing before her.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Hampshire, an it please your ladyship,&#8221;
answered Francis grateful for the attention.
She thought the lady must have recently arrived
else she would not stop to bandy words
with one who was without the pale of the
queen&#8217;s good will.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Hampshire? Ah, yes! I passed through
the shire once with Her Majesty on one of her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
progresses,&#8221; remarked she. &#8220;My lad, know
you that you are a pretty boy? But certes!
of course you do. Nathless, hear it again from
me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I thank your ladyship,&#8221; returned Francis
with blushing cheeks. &#8220;&#8217;Tis only your kindness
that bids you so to speak.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Hear the boy!&#8221; laughed the lady, shaking
her finger archly. &#8220;Nay; I shall not give
thee more compliments, but I would have
thee know that I am thy friend. I am aware
that the queen regards thee with disfavor, and
I would aid thee. If thou carest to know
more come to the Round Tower which is the
dormitory of the maids of honor this night.
There is my bower. I am the Lady Priscilla
Rutland. Know you the place?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Yes, my lady; but why, why?&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; began
Francis, but the lady interrupted
her.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Fie, fie, naughty boy! art thou so curious?
Ask no more until to-night.&#8221; With a quizzical
look she went on her way leaving the
girl staring after her.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;What said the Lady Priscilla to thee?&#8221;
demanded Edward Devereaux drawing near.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
&#8220;Beware of her, Francis Stafford. She is full
of wiles and deceit. &#8217;Tis unseemly to speak
ill of a woman, but I would fain warn thee.
When Mistress Priscilla is most gracious she
is bent on mischief. Therefore do I bid thee
to beware of her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Am I so rich in friends that I can cast
from me one who proffers amity?&#8221; inquired
the girl bitterly. &#8220;Who art thou, Master
Devereaux, that thou sayst do this, or do that,
and expect me to obey? Thou art mine foe,
the son of my father&#8217;s foe. What hast thou
to do with me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;The son of thy father&#8217;s foe, &#8217;tis true,&#8221; answered
Devereaux, &#8220;but not thine, Francis.
I make no war on women though I did unwittingly
strike thee once. I repent me that
ever I claimed to have slain that deer. Yet
hear me, mistress. Had the foresters not
come as they did, I would have given thee the
horns. I came to thy father&#8217;s castle to offer
them to thee, but dost thou remember how
didst greet me with scorn? And I, thinking
thee to be thy brother, did answer in like
manner.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Thou hast been long in the telling, master,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
remarked the girl scornfully. &#8220;Dost expect
me to believe thee?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Upon mine honor it is the truth. But to
the matter in hand. Believe me, &#8217;tis for thy
good to have naught to do with the Lady
Priscilla Rutland. I have been longer at the
court than thou and therefore know of that
of which I speak.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I am tired of thy watching and prating,&#8221;
declared Francis with spirit. &#8220;I am no child
to be chidden. Leave me, and know that
Francis Stafford will do as seemeth best to
her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;As you will, mistress. But if you come
to grief blame me not,&#8221; and the lad walked
away.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I hate him,&#8221; ejaculated the girl, her eyes
filling with angry tears. &#8220;I hate him with
his trite speeches and his sage advice! Why
doth he not leave me in peace? I will go to
the Lady Priscilla were it only to show him
that I regard not his words.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless she could not but wonder
why any lady should take such a sudden
interest in her, and a slight misgiving lurked
in her heart as she approached the Round
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
Tower, entered its portals, and made her way
to the Lady Priscilla&#8217;s bower.
</p>
<p>
The lady was lying on a couch surrounded
by her tire women.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;So, my pretty lad,&#8221; she said with a careless
glance, &#8220;thou hast come. Didst thou not
have enough of flattery? Gramercy! hath it
not always been true that sugar would catch
more flies than vinegar?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;What mean you?&#8221; stammered Francis,
her sensitive nature becoming aware of the
change in the lady&#8217;s manner from the caressing
sweetness of the morning to the mocking
air of the moment.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Didst think thy beauty had ensnared
me?&#8221; queried the lady quizzically. &#8220;It
hath. As the yellow metal of the earth hath
always thrown a spell over men so the red
gold of thy hair hath fascinated me. I dote
on thy locks, my fair page. Ay! so much so
that they and I shall ne&#8217;er be parted more.
Celeste! Annabelle! have at him!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Why, why,&#8221; cried the girl, struggling to
rise as the maids set upon her. &#8220;My lady!
My lady!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
But strong as her outdoor life had made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
her, she was no match for the damsels of the
Lady Priscilla. Soon she lay back in her
chair bound hand and foot.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;No harm is meant thee, master page,&#8221; remarked
the lady as, armed with a huge pair
of shears, she approached the maiden. &#8220;&#8217;Tis
only that thy silken tresses have tangled my
heart in their meshes until sleep hath fled my
pillow. I think on their lustre day and
night. And so do I take them to adorn mine
own pate. Thinkest thou that they could
cover a fairer head?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Oh, madam,&#8221; cried the girl tearfully as
the shears snipped relentlessly over her head,
for her hair had always been a weak point
with her. &#8220;O, spare my hair, I entreat!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Fie, sir page! Thou dost shame thy manhood.
True, thou art yet guiltless of beard,
yet still thou shouldst not play the woman.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;But, madam, I shall report this to the
queen. What think you she will say when
she knows that one of her ladies was guilty
of this outrage?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;She would not listen to thee, malapert.
Should she do so, I would say that Priscilla
Rutland knew no peace until she could emulate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
in her own locks the regal color that
crowned her august mistress&#8217; brow. That she
would stoop to do anything could she but
faintly follow such beauty. But I fear not
thy disclosure, sirrah. Art thou not in disgrace?
Then what boots it what thou sayst?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;True;&#8221; said Francis and opened her lips
no more. Clip, clip, went the shears until at
last all of her ringlets lay, a mass of ruddy
gold, in a great heap among the rushes.
Francis looked at them, and then at the
mocking face of the lady, and her heart
throbbed with wrath.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Madam,&#8221; she said as the Lady Priscilla
untied her bonds and she was once more free,
&#8220;I will never forgive this.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Thou art rude, sirrah,&#8221; laughed the lady.
&#8220;But I blame thee not. Be patient, master
page. I will come to thee when thy locks
have been woven into a wig and thou shalt
see how well they become me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Thou shalt never wear hair of mine,&#8221; cried
Francis, white with anger. Before the lady
or her maids could prevent she seized a lamp
from one of the scones and threw it into the
midst of red curls.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Help! Help!&#8221; cried the lady and the
maids simultaneously, for the lamp which was
of the simplest manufacture, being a wick fed
by oil, set fire instantly to the curls and surrounding
rushes. Scattering to the right and
left the maids called lustily: &#8220;Fire! Fire!
Seize the boy!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Staying only long enough to see that there
was no probability of saving the hair, Francis
dashed through the arras, and fled through
chamber after chamber trying to find an exit.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;This way,&#8221; she heard a voice call as, bewildered
and confused, she paused, not knowing
which way to turn.
</p>
<p>
To her amazement, Edward Devereaux stood
in a door of a chamber beckoning to her. She
gave an exclamation of surprise but, enemy
though she considered him, followed him
without hesitation. Through a maze of rooms
the boy led the way with the air of one to
whom they were familiar; then down a flight
of steps, through an open window and out
upon a balcony that overlooked the great
garden.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;We will conceal ourselves in the shrubbery,&#8221;
he said vaulting lightly over the rail
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
into the garden below, followed closely by the
girl. They stopped in the shadow of a clump
of close clipped black yews. &#8220;Here we can
remain,&#8221; he said, &#8220;until the hue and cry is
over. What happened, Francis?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Francis poured forth her story rapidly.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I hate this vile court,&#8221; she cried with a
burst of passionate tears as she concluded. &#8220;I
want my home! Oh, I want to go home!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I blame you not, Francis Stafford,&#8221; said
Edward Devereaux forbearing to taunt her
with the fact that had she heeded his words
this last misery would not have come upon
her. &#8220;You feel as we all feel at times, yet are
we constrained to bide here. Were it in truth
to serve the queen, God bless her, there would
be joy in staying. But to be at the beck and
call of every noble; to bear the trains of the
ladies or dance attendance upon them is not
the life that a youth wishes. I pity thee,
Francis, and thy plight is not so bad as it will
be should yon tower burn to the ground.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Oh!&#8221; Francis looked up with startled
eyes. &#8220;I did not think of that. It was not
my intent to burn the tower. Think you that
it is in danger, Edward?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Mayhap not,&#8221; answered the boy regarding
the tower with anxious eyes. &#8220;We can but
watch.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The two stood looking at the building in
silence. As the moments passed the lights
disappeared from the windows, darkness
settled over the tower, and all was quiet.
Francis drew a long breath of relief.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;It was unthinking and unheeding in me
to throw the light,&#8221; she said. &#8220;What if the
building had burned? The castle might have
followed and thus endangered the life of the
queen. Oh, miserable girl that I am! What
would my father say to me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Be not so cast down,&#8221; comforted Edward.
&#8220;Thou hadst great provocation, and pardon
me, mistress, but thy temper is not of the
gentlest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I know,&#8221; said Francis with unwonted
meekness. &#8220;But when I saw my hair, my
pretty hair,&#8221; she paused, her utterance choked,
unwilling to give way to her grief before him.
</p>
<p>
The boy touched the shorn head compassionately.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;&#8217;Twill not be long before it will grow
again,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And so long as thou must
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
wear that garb it will be all the better. I
have seen many longing glances cast at thy
locks, Francis. &#8217;Tis wonder that such mishap
hath not occurred before. If thou dost not
wear them, thou hast at least put it out of
their power to grace the head of another.
There is something in that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Yes;&#8221; said Francis with a flash of spirit.
&#8220;I would not that harm should come to the
palace, yet glad am I that the tresses were
consumed. Thou hast been kind to me,
Master Devereaux. And yet thou art mine
enemy!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Better an open enemy than a deceitful
friend,&#8221; quoth Edward sententiously. &#8220;Say
no more, Francis Stafford. If I have been of
service to thee, let it in some measure atone
for my churlishness in killing that deer. But
we must to our several abodes else we shall
bring the displeasure of my lord chamberlain
upon us. We shall have enough to answer to
this charge. I fear the issue to-morrow.
Come!&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>WHAT FRANCIS OVERHEARD</h3>
</div>

<p>
Francis awaited the coming of the day with
some trepidation, fearing that she might be
obliged to render an account of the night before.
And indeed had the result been other
than it was, she would have been called to a
very serious reckoning. It was marvelous
that there was not more damage sustained,
but it came to her ears during the day that
the fire had been extinguished before it had
gone beyond the rushes. The hair had been
totally consumed.
</p>
<p>
The girl soon became aware that the episode
was known throughout the court. When the
Lady Priscilla Rutland made her appearance
there was subdued laughter and titterings
among the ladies and their gallants. Francis&#8217;
shorn head was the cynosure of all eyes, but
her manner was so haughty that it repelled
all facetious remarks.
</p>
<p>
The incident was recounted to Elizabeth.
The queen laughed heartily at the discomfiture
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
of the lady for she was never ill pleased
when one of her maids brought ridicule upon
herself, and turning to Lord Shrope who stood
near while it was being related she remarked
graciously:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Upon my word, my lord, there is more in
that charge of thine than I thought. If certain
rumors which have come to our ears be
not verified we will have him placed nearer
our person. Methinks such spirit well trained
could be made useful.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;You speak truly, madam,&#8221; returned Lord
Shrope. &#8220;I know not what is the nature of
the rumors, but knowing Francis Stafford, I
make bold to say that Rumor hath played
thee false.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;We shall see, my lord,&#8221; was Elizabeth&#8217;s
reply.
</p>
<p>
Lord Shrope feared to press the matter, but
as soon as it was expedient he hastened to
seek Francis.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;The tide hath turned, child,&#8221; he ejaculated.
&#8220;Fate hath at last become propitious
to thee, for Elizabeth hath begun to look
upon thee with kindness. The accident of
the hair hath done for thee what naught else
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
hath been able to do,&#8221; and he told her what
the queen had said.
</p>
<p>
To his surprise Francis was not so elated as
he expected. On the contrary his words filled
her with alarm.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Said the queen of what the rumors consisted?&#8221;
she asked with uneasiness.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;No, child; but there can be naught of
harm in them. Thy life hath been so innocent
in thy Hampshire wilds that there is no
act or thought of thine but could be laid open
to the queen. Thou hast naught to fear from
any gossip. &#8217;Tis only when conscious of baseness
that we fear to have our lives searched.
Thou hast done nothing wrong; therefore
fear nothing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My lord,&#8221; said Francis touched by his
faith, &#8220;you honor me too much. Pray
Heaven that you may never have cause to repent
your words.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Tut, child! why should I repent them?
Now be advised by me, and take advantage of
the humor of the queen. A good husbandman,
as thou knowest, improves the sunshine
to make hay. We must do likewise. It is
the queen&#8217;s habit to repair to her closet to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
play each day upon the virginals. This she
doeth for the most part privately, but, as she
plays markedly well, she is not ill pleased to
have others hear her. Especially is this true
if it transpires accidentally. Now do you
place yourself in the gallery behind the arras.
When the queen plays seem to be drawn into
her presence by the sweetness of her music,
even as Orpheus drew Eurydice from among
the demons. Then excuse thy intrusion with
some well-timed phrase. Elizabeth is great,
but she hath a weakness for judicious flattery
the which, in truth, doth not ill accord
with her femininity. Then, if she receive
thee graciously, throw thyself upon her mercy
and confess all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;But, my lord, doth it not savor too much
of guile?&#8221; objected Francis, her spirit revolting
at the manner of the transaction.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;It doth, Francis, but what would you?
&#8217;Tis the manner of all courts, and the queen
is not deceived thereby. Such things the
rather appeal to her if the fashion of them be
adroit. What boots the method then if the
end is accomplished, and the queen pleased.
No harm is done.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My lord, I like not the style of it. It
seemeth to me that nothing is ever done in a
straightforward manner any more. Is life
full of naught but crookedness and devious
windings and turnings? Let me go to the
queen openly, I beseech you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay; &#8217;twill avail thee nothing. Subdue
thy pride for once, and be guided by one to
whom all the ways of the court are as an open
book. Thou dost hold thyself with too much
of spirit. Set not thyself above those who are
older and of superior wisdom.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Francis felt the rebuke so sharply spoken,
and answered in a conciliatory manner.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My lord, I intend not to hold my judgment
higher than thine for thou art of superior
wisdom and age. I am willing to be
guided by thee, but I would that the end
could be gained by other ways than those of
crookedness.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;&#8217;Tis for thy parents&#8217; sake as well as thine,&#8221;
observed the other. &#8220;Thou knowest how full
of anxiety they must be, and how solicitously
they await thy return. Thou shouldst be
willing to adopt any course that would allay
that uneasiness and restore thee to their arms.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;And I am willing,&#8221; responded the girl
with fervor. &#8220;Away, indecision! Away,
doubts! No longer will I listen to ye; for
what says Will Shakspeare:
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto; '>
<tr><td><p style='margin-left:3em; margin-top:0.5em; margin-bottom:0.0em'>
&#8220;&#8216;Our doubts are traitors,

And make us lose the good we oft might win,
</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p style='margin-left:3em; margin-top:0.0em; margin-bottom:0.5em'>
By fearing to attempt.&#8217;
</p></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Speak on, my lord. Unfold again thy plan,
and I will follow it, be the issue what it
may.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;There spake the Stafford blood,&#8221; exclaimed
the nobleman approvingly. &#8220;Listen,
girl, then haste thee to the queen&#8217;s gallery;
for on the hazard of this die depends thy fortune.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Francis gave heed to all of his instructions,
and then made her way to the queen&#8217;s apartment.
The chamber was unoccupied, and she
looked about in quest of some suitable hiding-place.
At one end of the room the mullioned
window opened upon a long balcony which
overlooked the private garden. Francis resolved
to place herself there rather than behind
the rich tapestries.
</p>
<p>
She had scarcely taken her position near an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
open window where she could both see and
hear without being herself seen when Elizabeth
entered. To the girl&#8217;s consternation she
was not alone, but attended by Walsingham,
Burleigh, Hatton and Leicester.
</p>
<p>
Elizabeth seemed much agitated, and Francis,
unwilling to be a listener in matters of
state, looked about her for some means of retiring
when her attention was caught by a name.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;And thou art sure, Walsingham, of the
truth of this matter? Hast thou indisputable
proofs that Anthony Babington is guilty
of design to murder us? Long have I known
that he inclined toward the claims of our
cousin, Mary of Scotland, but so too do my
Lord Stafford, my Lord Percy, and other of
our subjects. Yet none of these gentlemen
would lift a hand against the person of his
queen. Art sure of what thou art saying?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I have here the proofs, Your Majesty,&#8221; returned
Walsingham. &#8220;Here is a tablet upon
which is painted the face of Babington and
five others who are associated with him in
perilous enterprise, as thou seest engraved.
Further: here are letters which have passed
between Mary of Scotland and the conspirators
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
in which she commends the performance
of the deed. The act was to be committed on
thy way to chapel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Then, my lord, if this be true, why have
you not apprehended these men? Methinks
that the safety of your queen should be your
first consideration.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Her Highness is right,&#8221; cried Leicester.
&#8220;Upon her life depends not only the safety of
her ministers but the welfare of the Commonwealth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Pardon me, my liege lady,&#8221; said Walsingham,
&#8220;if I have seemed to be careless of that
life which is so dear to all of us. But I
wished to involve Mary so deeply in this conspiracy
as to open the way to rid the country
of her. Your Majesty will never be safe while
that woman lives. She is a menace as long as
she remains in England.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Deport her then,&#8221; suggested Elizabeth.
&#8220;France would gladly receive her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay, madam. That were to place her
where she could abet the design of Phillip to
invade England. That bourne from which no
traveler returns is the only proper abode for
Mary Stuart. And for thy protection, madam,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
I took precautions. Ballard, the priest, as
thou knowest, hath long since been confined in
the Tower. Babington has been lodged in
mine own house where I could watch him.
He can be taken at any time. That time hath
now come. The warrants are issued, not only
for him, but for Tilney, Savage, Tichbourne,
Stafford and other conspirators associated in
the enterprise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Stafford! Francis gave a faint gasp, and
started up in terror. Her father? Was he to
be taken with these men? But the queen
was speaking:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Lord Stafford?&#8221; she said interrogatively.
&#8220;Stafford, Walsingham? Surely not he. He
is an honorable gentleman, and would not be
concerned in such foul designs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Did I not tell you some time since that it
was whispered in mine ear that Stafford and
his son delivered letters to Mary? The whisper
hath become a certainty. Those letters
were to apprise the queen of the intent to slay
thee, deliver her from custody, and raise her
to the throne. This hour will I send to arrest
Lord Stafford as well as the others. And
then&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;

<p>
&#8220;Death to the traitors,&#8221; said Burleigh impressively.
&#8220;They must perish, as must all
who are traitors to England and to England&#8217;s
queen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Francis waited to hear no more. Her father
to be taken and tried for treason? That would
mean death. She must warn him.
</p>
<p>
She ran quickly to the other end of the
balcony, and swung herself over the balustrade.
Hastily she made her way through the
grounds to Lord Shrope&#8217;s lodgings, bursting in
upon that astonished nobleman just as he was
about to partake of his dinner.

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>AN ADVENTURE</h3>
</div>

<p>
&#8220;I must see thee, my lord, alone,&#8221; she cried
in such tones that her friend arose without a
word and conducted her into his own withdrawing
room.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;How now, Francis? What mishap hath
attended thy enterprise? Gramercy, girl!
what is it? Thou art disheveled and as excited
as though some untoward accident had
befallen thee. What said the queen? Say
what hath happened?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My lord,&#8221; gasped the girl scarcely able to
articulate, &#8220;once thou didst love my father.
For the sake of that love, I pray you, grant
me aid to reach him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Child, what is it?&#8221; cried he in alarm
&#8220;Tell me what hath occurred? Hath Elizabeth
sent thee from her?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I have not seen the queen,&#8221; said Francis
trying to speak with calmness. &#8220;After I had
hidden myself as you bade me, the queen in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
company with Hatton, Lord Burleigh, Sir
Francis Walsingham and Lord Leicester entered
the chamber. They discovered to her a
plot to slay her, and to elevate Mary of Scotland
to the throne, furthered by Anthony
Babington, and others, among whom they
named my father. My lord, I must go to him.
Aid me I beseech you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Lord Shrope&#8217;s face turned white, and he
withdrew himself from the girl&#8217;s clinging
hands.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;A plot to slay the queen? The saints defend
us! Girl, I cannot, I dare not aid thee.
It would be as much as my life is worth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;You must, my lord. I must reach my
father. I must and will, my lord.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;If William Stafford be concerned in conspiracy
against Elizabeth he must abide the
consequences. I will aid no traitor to the
queen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My lord, he is no traitor,&#8221; cried the girl in
despair. &#8220;He did wish to release Mary from
bondage, for he had compassion on her misery
as who hath not? But that he is party to the
design to murder the queen, I deny. I know,
my lord, I know.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;What do you know? Are you too engaged
in conspiracies? I thought thee as innocent
as the daisy that grows in thy father&#8217;s
field.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I am in no plots nor conspiracies, sir,&#8221;
declared Francis. &#8220;But we lose time in idle
words. Give me thine aid to reach my father,
I implore thee.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Never, girl! And thou,&mdash;thou must be
restrained of thy liberty, for I see that thou
knowest much of this matter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
He turned toward the door as he spoke, but
Francis was before him.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My lord,&#8221; she said, and there was determination
in her manner, &#8220;thou shalt not
touch me, nor cause others to touch me.
Heaven be my witness that I speak truth
when I say that my father is innocent of design
to murder the queen. I must have means
to reach him, and thou must give them to
me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Must? Thou useth strange terms, girl!
Not only will I not give thee aid, but I will
take thee into custody.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
He sprang toward her, but the girl turned
upon him fiercely with uplifted dagger.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Lay but one finger upon me, and I will
slay thee,&#8221; she said in a low intense voice.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Francis Stafford, this from you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Ay, sir, from me. I would kill thee, or
any who sought to hold me from my father.
The queen herself should not keep me from
him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Seditious girl! those are words of treason.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I care not,&#8221; cried Francis recklessly. &#8220;I
care not, my lord. And if thou wilt not give
me aid thy life shall pay the forfeit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Dost threaten me, girl?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Ay! if you deny me. I will slay thee and
take thy signet ring.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;If I aid thee, what then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I will tell no word of it to any man,&#8221; declared
she earnestly. &#8220;No word, my lord.
Thou shalt not be implicated in any manner,
as indeed, why should you? I am determined
to reach my father, and if to do so I must kill
thee, I will do so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I believe in thee, Francis. Thy love for him
is great. For the sake of that love, and also
for that which once I bore him, I will aid thee.
Not because of thy threats, girl. They are
but talk of an excited brain.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay, my lord; you do me wrong. I
would carry them out if it were necessary,
albeit I am glad to have gained the end without
bloodshed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Here is my signet ring, Francis. By that
token the boatmen will take thee to London.
By that token also thou mayest obtain horses
at my house. Go, girl! Even now thou
mayest be too late. As for me, with that ring
on thee, &#8217;twill be my undoing, but&mdash;take it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Say that I stole it, my lord. Say that I
forced it from thee,&#8221; cried Francis, receiving
it from him joyfully.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;That thou forced it from me?&#8221; echoed Lord
Shrope with a laugh. &#8220;Why, girl, I had
rather be beheaded.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Then will I leave it at thy house in London
when I shall have obtained a horse,&#8221; said
the girl dropping upon one knee by his side.
&#8220;Forgive me, my lord, for my words,&#8221; and
she kissed his hand with fervor. &#8220;Thou hast
always been kind to me, but my father, sir.
There is naught that I would not do for him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Thou art forgiven. But hasten! Time is
precious.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Without further parley Francis bounded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
from the room, and hurried through the palace
yard, out of the great gate and down to
the steps that led to the river.
</p>
<p>
Within the yard and at the landing-place
there was a great deal of confusion. Servitors
were running to and fro, courtiers were grouped
together talking excitedly, while numerous
officials and dignitaries were taking boat for
London. Among these latter the girl discerned
the form of Walsingham, the queen&#8217;s
secretary of state. Her heart sank at sight
of him.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;He goes to send pursuivants for my father,&#8221;
was her thought, and her conclusion was correct.
The secretary was indeed on his way to
cause the arrest of the conspirators.
</p>
<p>
Seeing her among the followers of Walsingham,
the watermen permitted her to enter one
of the wherries and she found herself being
carried to London more expeditiously than
would otherwise have been the case. There
was no indulgence on the part of the boatmen
in song. Stern and silent they bent to their
oars, responding with all their mights to
Walsingham&#8217;s &#8220;Faster, my men, faster!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
It seemed to Francis that they no sooner
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
reached London than the whole city was
ablaze with the news. Traffic was suspended,
and citizens discussed in hushed accents the
plot to kill the queen.
</p>
<p>
Francis made haste to Lord Shrope&#8217;s house
in Broad Street, and by means of the ring,
procured an excellent horse. Mounting him
she urged the animal to great speed and was
soon outside the city.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Heaven grant that I may reach my father
before Walsingham&#8217;s men,&#8221; she murmured.
&#8220;I have gotten the start of them somehow.
Let me make the most of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Now the reason for her advantage was this:
several of the conspirators, notably the six
who had associated together to assassinate the
queen, were in London awaiting their opportunity.
Anthony Babington lodged at Walsingham&#8217;s
own house, lured there by the wily
secretary under pretense of taking him into
his confidence; while Babington, to further
his own ends, seemingly acquiesced in the
minister&#8217;s plans. It was a case of duplicity
against duplicity, craft matched against craft,
with the odds on the side of Elizabeth&#8217;s brainy
secretary. For the reason that the chief conspirators
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
were in London, Walsingham tarried
there to apprehend them before sending forth
to arrest the other gentlemen concerned in the
plot who lived somewhat remotely from the
city. But the conspirators had gotten wind
of his intentions, and when he reached the
city they had fled.
</p>
<p>
All this the girl did not know until long
afterward. Now she pushed forward with the
utmost expedition, hoping to reach the Hall
before the pursuivants started. The weather
was warm, it being the last of July, and the
Hall was two days&#8217; journey from London by
hard riding. Therefore whatever distance she
might gain in the first stage of the trip would
be of incalculable advantage.
</p>
<p>
Toward the end of the day, her horse showing
great signs of fatigue, Francis was of necessity
forced to allow the animal to settle into a
walk. As the steed slackened pace the girl relapsed
into thought. So absorbed did she become
that she was startled into something
closely akin to fright when a man sprang from
behind some trees, ran into the road, and
seized her horse by the bridle.
</p>
<p>
At this time the woods and forests of England
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
were infested by highwaymen, gipsies, or
Egyptians as they were called, and wandering
vagrants whose depredations had been the
cause of severe legislation to rid the country
of its pests. It had not occurred to Francis
that she might be molested by any of these,
and she could not forbear a slight scream at
the appearance of the man.
</p>
<p>
His clothing, though of rich material, was
torn and ragged as though it had been caught
by thorns in the unfrequented paths of the
forest. His head was bare of covering, his
locks disheveled; his face and hands were of an
uneven dark color as though stained with
some decoction unskilfully applied. His
whole manner was so distraught that Francis
trembled excessively.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Boy,&#8221; cried the man wildly, &#8220;dismount,
and give me thy horse.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
At the first sound of his voice the girl
started violently, leaned forward and scanned
his face keenly.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Anthony Babington,&#8221; she cried as she
recognized the unhappy man, &#8220;how came you
here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;You know me?&#8221; cried Babington in dismay.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
&#8220;Who in the fiend&#8217;s name are you that
know me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;One that knows all of your nefarious purpose,&#8221;
said Francis accusingly, her girl nature
imputing to this man her father&#8217;s trouble.
&#8220;Wretched man, knowest thou that the queen&#8217;s
men search for thee even now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Ha!&#8221; cried Babington peering into her
face, &#8220;&#8217;tis the page that was with Stafford at
Salisbury. Boy, where is thy master?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;At Stafford Hall.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;And thou! Thou art not with him.
Hast thou been at court?&#8221; Babington peered
suspiciously into her countenance.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Yes;&#8221; answered the unsuspecting girl. &#8220;I
have been at court, Anthony Babington, where
all thy deed is known. The whole palace,
ay! the whole city of London is in an
uproar because of the discovery of thy intention
to kill the queen. I was present when
the matter was discovered to the queen.
Death will be thy portion if thou art apprehended.
Why stand you here? If you would
save yourself, fly!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Thou present when it was discovered?
Then it is thou who hast betrayed us? Varlet!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
Base brawler of men&#8217;s secrets! die, ere
thou canst betray others.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
His dagger flashed in the air as he spoke,
but ere it could descend Francis gave him a
sharp, stinging cut across the face with her
whip. With a cry of rage Babington let fall
the poniard, and before he could regain the
weapon the girl dashed away. On she rode,
never stopping until at length the night fell,
and she knew that she was far from the
wretched Babington.

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>A SHELTER FROM THE STORM</h3>
</div>

<p>
The morning of the second day found
Francis once more on her way without having
seen any of the queen&#8217;s men. The day was
unusually warm, and both the girl and her
horse, wearied by the hard riding, showed the
effects of the journey. But fatigued though
she was she pushed resolutely on, pausing only
to care for the tired animal. At length the
road entered a deep wood and she gave a sigh
of relief as the grateful shade of the trees enveloped
her. The horse too seemed to revive
somewhat and went forward with more briskness.
</p>
<p>
So dense was the shade that Francis was
not aware that the sky had become overcast
with clouds until a distant peal of thunder
broke upon her ear.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;A storm is coming,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I must
seek shelter; but where?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
It was a problem that would have puzzled a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
head older and wiser than that of Francis
Stafford. She was in the midst of a dense
forest. She looked about her in dismay.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Beshrew me!&#8221; she uttered, &#8220;these woods
are impenetrable enough to furnish hiding-place
for Robin Hood and all his men.
Surely there must be an inn or house somewhere
near. Patience! I will find shelter.
On, good horse!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The mutterings of the thunder became
louder and deeper as the storm approached.
The clouds scudded across the heavens swiftly,
borne on the wings of a heavy wind. Suddenly
a blinding flash of lightning zigzagged
across the sky followed by a deafening crash
of thunder, and the storm broke in all its
force. The rain came down in torrents. The
trees bent and swayed in the wind, tossing
their proud heads as if in defiance to the storm
king. The horse snorted in terror as flash
after flash of lightning blazed across the road.
Francis was drenched to the skin, but she
struggled on, soothing the frightened animal
as best she could.
</p>
<p>
Presently she thought she saw an opening
in the trees. Drawing closer she was overjoyed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
to find that there really was a path
through the wood. Turning into it she followed
it for some distance, finally coming to
an open glade where stood what looked to be
an ancient inn.
</p>
<p>
One wing had fallen into decay. The rose
covered trellis of the porch lay rotting on the
ground. All about the building hung an air
of dilapidation and decay that forbade the
thought of cheer. One part of the tumbled
down structure looked as though it might
serve as a shelter, and the girl hastened to the
door of this portion and knocked.
</p>
<p>
There was no response, and Francis rapped
again; this time more loudly than before, resolving
to force the door should there be no
answer. She waited a few moments, and then
there came a high shrill voice from behind the
closed door.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Who&#8217;s there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;One who desires shelter from the storm.
Open, i&#8217; God&#8217;s name!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;And who be ye that seek shelter of Dame
Margery? Know you not that men call me
the white witch?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I care not,&#8221; exclaimed Francis impatiently.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
&#8220;Open, woman, else I will force the
door.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
There was a muttering of protest, then the
bolts were drawn, and the door opened. A
woman stood in the aperture. A woman, old
and bent, and looking not unlike the witch
she called herself. A hood of brown sat on
her white hair; a brown lappet was thrown
about her, and she supported herself by means
of a staff. Her black eyes regarded the girl
with keenness from under her shaggy brows.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Now thou art brave, forsooth, who dares
take shelter here,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There are those,
and they are many, who would brave the
fiercest storm rather than risk Dame Margery&#8217;s
evil eye.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;But not I,&#8221; said Francis boldly. Nevertheless
she made the sign of the cross, for the
age was a superstitious one and the belief in
witches and witchcraft well nigh universal.
&#8220;Good dame, tell me, I pray, where I may
put my horse. Give us both shelter, and thou
shall have this angel for thy guerdon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
She held the gold piece out as she spoke.
The woman&#8217;s fingers closed over it eagerly.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Back of the house are the stables,&#8221; she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
said a trifle more civilly. &#8220;There will ye find
food for the beast as well as cover. But thou
wilt have to be thine own groom, young sir.
These old bones be racked with rheums.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I thank you,&#8221; answered Francis briefly.
Following the direction indicated by the beldame
she led her horse round the house where
she found the stables in somewhat better condition
than she had expected. After looking
after the welfare of the animal she muttered
a short prayer, and entered the dwelling with
a bold front.
</p>
<p>
The door gave entrance into a large, low
ceiled room whose rafters were grimed with
smoke and dirt. A low bed stood in one
corner of the room; a small deal table and
three chairs completed the simple furnishings,
but the girl&#8217;s eyes were caught by the strings
of herbs that depended from the walls, and
the cabalistic signs that were everywhere in
evidence. A fire burned on the hearth and
over it, depending from a crane, hung a large
kettle in which something savory was brewing.
</p>
<p>
A black cat which had been stretched near
the fire rose at her entrance, and spat as if he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
resented the intrusion as well as his mistress.
Francis glanced at the mysterious signs, the
black cat, the old woman, and a half wish
came into her mind that she had braved the
fury of the storm rather than enter such an
abode. As if in answer to her thought the
dame spoke:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Draw nigh the fire, boy, and dry thy wet
garments. Marry! hearest thou the rain?
Even the dwelling of a witch, I trow, is better
than to be out in&#8217;t. Hark!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The storm had redoubled its fury. The
wind shrieked and howled as though a thousand
demons were loosed from durance and
were exulting in their freedom. The rain
came down in sheets, while peal on peal of
thunder crashed and rolled. Francis shuddered
and drew nearer the fire. The steam
arose from her saturated garments, and rendered
her uncomfortable. The old woman
noticed her discomfort and said not unkindly:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Boy, no garments have I of thy sex, but
if thou wilt play the woman for the nonce
thou canst have of mine apparel until thine
own be dried.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
For the first time since she had left the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
court Francis laughed. She flushed rosy red
under the old woman&#8217;s glance, and then grew
bewildered and confused at her continued
scrutiny, and answered with an effort at self-command.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I thank you, my good dame, but I will
stay as I am an it please you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Content yourself,&mdash;master,&#8221; answered the
dame with the slightest hesitation before the
word. &#8220;&#8217;Twas but to soften thy distress.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
She spoke no more, but busied herself about
the brew over the fire. Presently she placed
some of the stew before the girl, saying,
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Eat, sir. Thou wilt find it to thy liking,
I trow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;It is in sooth,&#8221; replied Francis falling to
heartily. Under the influence of warmth and
comfort her fear of the woman had vanished.
&#8220;Think you, good mother, that the storm will
soon pass?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay;&#8221; answered she her face softening
at the <a name="appellation" id="appellation"></a><ins class="trnote" title="Transcriber&#8217;s Note: apellation in original text">appellation</ins>. &#8220;Not till midnight comes;

</p></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The girl&#8217;s face clouded.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Then I must forth at midnight,&#8221; she declared.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Thy need must be urgent that impels
thee onward through the darkness,&#8221; observed
the woman keenly. &#8220;Boy, what is thy business?
Would have me read the stars for its
issue?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay, mother,&#8221; answered Francis in agitated
tones. &#8220;Were it favorable all would
be well, but if it were evil I would not know
of it. But it will not be ill. It must not,
shall not be!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
She arose and paced the floor, chafing that
she must be inactive when time was so precious.
The dame regarded her curiously.
Presently she spoke.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Mistress, I may not call thee because of
thy garb. Master, I cannot because of thy sex;
but whatsoe&#8217;er thou art, tell old Margery why
thou art so dressed, and why you wander
forth alone?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Woman, are you in very truth a witch?&#8221;
cried the girl in astonishment.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;So men call me,&#8221; returned Margery dryly.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;But save for the few who were told, not
one at the court penetrated my masquerade,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
said Francis. &#8220;Then how is it, that thou, at
our first meeting, know that my dress covers
a maiden?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Old Margery hath lived long, and her
eyes are sharp,&#8221; answered the dame. &#8220;But
tell me. What brings you hither, if you are
of the court?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Francis paused in front of the woman and
looked long and earnestly into her eyes.
Something she saw there made her say impulsively:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Good mother, thou must be in truth the
witch men call thee, because thine eyes impel
me to tell thee all. Listen! and I will unfold
the tale from the beginning.&#8221; And she recounted
the affair of Elizabeth&#8217;s coming, the
reason for donning the page&#8217;s dress, her going
to court, and now the cause of her desire to
reach her father. The woman listened attentively.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Child, thou hast done well. And thou
sayst that none of the queen&#8217;s men have passed
thee?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;None, mother. I have outstripped them
all,&#8221; exulted Francis. &#8220;Let me but continue
in the lead for a few hours longer so that my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
father may have opportunity to get to a place
of safety, and I care not how soon they come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
At this moment there came the sound of
hoarse shouting of men, followed by the clatter
of horses&#8217; hoofs, and then above the storm
came a loud knocking at the door.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Open in the name of the queen,&#8221; came the
stern command.

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>FRANCIS FINDS A HELPER</h3>
</div>

<p>
&#8220;It is the pursuivants,&#8221; cried Francis in
consternation. &#8220;Good mother, hide me, I entreat.
They must not know that I am here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Then, indeed, was she thankful that she
had taken the old woman into her confidence.
The beldame arose and with an agility that
was surprising in one of her years glided
across the room, and opened a small door that
was so small, and black, and grimy that it
had escaped the girl&#8217;s attention.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Enter,&#8221; whispered the woman. &#8220;Enter
and fear nothing. They shall not know of
thy presence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Francis passed through the entrance and
closed the door after her just as the rapping
came again with renewed vigor.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;What, ho inside!&#8221; came a voice. &#8220;Give
entrance, whosoe&#8217;er ye be, else it will be made
by force.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Now who be ye who would seek admittance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
to the house of a white witch?&#8221; asked
Dame Margery&#8217;s shrill voice.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Gramercy! we will show who we be,&#8221; and
there was a sound as of a man pressing against
the panels of the door. The dame undid the
fastenings and threw open the door. A man
who had evidently put his shoulder against it
for the purpose of forcing an entrance sprawled
his entire length on the floor. With a loud
laugh at his <a name="discomfiture" id="discomfiture"></a><ins class="trnote" title="Transcriber&#8217;s Note: discomforture in original text">discomfiture</ins> several other men
crowded into the room.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Marry! what an unmannerly welcome,&#8221;
cried the man picking himself up. &#8220;My good
woman, is this the way to receive guests?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Be that the way to enter a body&#8217;s house?&#8221;
cried the dame. &#8220;Ye bean&#8217;t gentle, surely,
else ye would know that an old woman can&#8217;t
move the swiftest when she&#8217;s bent with the
rheums.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I crave thy pardon, dame,&#8221; said the leader
who was evidently a man of high degree. &#8220;I
crave thy pardon for such an unceremonious
entrance. I thought that no one was within.
Give us shelter from the storm and supper.
Then must we on our way. We pay for your
trouble.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Well, ye won&#8217;t get either supper or shelter
here. Do ye take this for an inn?&#8221; she asked
querulously.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay, dame; for then would we find greeting
and good cheer,&#8221; returned the leader good
naturedly. &#8220;This seemeth more in truth like
witch&#8217;s dwelling. Whatsoe&#8217;er it be here we
stay until the storm abates. We are from the
queen, woman.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Dame Margery said no more, but began to
bestir herself about the supper.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Some of you see about the horses,&#8221; commanded
the leader, placing himself before the
fire.
</p>
<p>
Two of the men went out and presently returned.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;&#8217;Tis a crazy sort of a barn, sir,&#8221; said one,
&#8220;but it encloses as good a bit of horseflesh as
e&#8217;er trod a heath. How now, dame? Where
didst thou get so fine a horse?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Are there men here other than us?&#8221; asked
the leader hastily. &#8220;If there be we must
look to ourselves for we are on the queen&#8217;s
business, and naught must delay us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;No men, sir,&#8221; answered Margery.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;The stable is bad, sayst thou, Martin?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
with an expression of relief on his face as he
heard the dame&#8217;s reply. &#8220;The dwelling, too, is
none of the best.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;None asked ye to enter it,&#8221; said the
woman bluntly. &#8220;An ye like not mine
abode, ye can leave it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Hold thy tongue, old beldame!&#8221; said the
leader imperiously. &#8220;Nay;&#8221; as the dame
flashed an angry glance at him, &#8220;be not prodigal
of thy looks. An thou cast the evil eye
on me, I&#8217;ll sheathe my blade in thy flesh.
We want no witch&#8217;s work here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Margery made no answer, but placed the
supper before them. The men fell to, and
soon disposed of all that was on the table.
Then the leader began to show signs of impatience
for the storm had not yet subsided.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Beshrew me!&#8221; he exclaimed to his companions.
&#8220;I fear that we will be compelled
to pass the night in this vile place. Marry!
how it rains!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;It doth, Master Wainwright,&#8221; answered
one. &#8220;But better the storm than pass the
night in the abode of a witch, and if yon dame
be not the veriest witch in the kingdom then
I ne&#8217;er saw one. The house makes me creepy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
&#8217;Tis fitting place for some dark deed to be
committed. The horse in the stable, I dare
say, belonged to some belated traveler caught
like ourselves in a storm afar from an inn.
Marked you how she answered me not when I
spoke on&#8217;t? How the wind howls, and how
blue the taper burns! &#8217;Sblood! I&#8217;d sooner
be out in the storm.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I would not,&#8221; observed Master Wainwright.
&#8220;One drenching a day is enough for
me. Marry! there is naught to do but to
possess our souls in patience. I dare say, we
will o&#8217;ertake the boy on the morrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Marry! yes, master. If he be out in this
storm he will drown like a rat. Who would
have thought that he could have kept so far
ahead of us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;They ride fast who flee from justice,&#8221;
quoth another sententiously. &#8220;If we be not
careful he will outstrip us, and we will be void
of our quarry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Be not alarmed. We will o&#8217;ertake him,&#8221;
reassured the leader. &#8220;Though I like not for
the storm to continue. It delays us too much.&#8221;
He mused for a moment and then turned to
the dame suddenly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My good woman,&#8221; he said, &#8220;have ye seen
aught of a boy to-day?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;A boy? What boy?&#8221; asked she stupidly.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;A boy of the court in page&#8217;s dress. Hast
thou seen him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;No boy have I seen this day,&#8221; answered
the dame stolidly. &#8220;Marry! nor for many
days for the matter of that. What did ye
want with the boy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;We have a warrant for his arrest,&#8221; said
the leader. &#8220;Also one for his father, Lord
William Stafford. What think you, my good
dame? There has been foul attempt to slay
the queen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Ye do well to say &#8217;attempt,&#8217;&#8221; said the
woman. &#8220;Elizabeth will never die by the
hand of an assassin.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Say ye so?&#8221; asked the leader eagerly.
&#8220;Good dame, how will she die?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Not in her bed. No hand shall be raised
against her, and she dies by misease; yet shall
she not die in bed,&#8221; and the old woman nodded
prophetically.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Ask her how long the queen will live,&#8221;
whispered one. &#8220;The queen waxeth in years
and it may not be amiss to be prepared.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Seek no further, sir,&#8221; said Margery
quickly. &#8220;Know that thou wilt never live
to see the day of her death. Thy time is nigh.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Now a murrain on thee for that foul
prophecy,&#8221; cried the man starting up, his
hand on the hilt of his sword. But Master
Wainwright interposed.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;No brawling, sirrah. We are on the
queen&#8217;s business. Thou and thy right arm
may be needed ere it be completed. Have
done!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The man sank back. Quiet fell upon them,
broken only by the sweep of the rain against
the house and the fitful howling of the wind.
Night deepened, and still the storm continued.
The men disposed themselves about the hearth
for their damp clothing made them chilly,
and soon one after another fell into slumber,
until, after a time, all were asleep. Then
Dame Margery rose to her feet and tiptoeing
to the small door opened it, and passed out of
the room.
</p>
<p>
Francis stood just within where she could
hear everything that went on in the outer
chamber. She came forward eagerly as the
woman entered.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Mother,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;those men must be
detained here, but how? Canst thou help
me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Child, I could make them sleep until the
sun was high noon, but they are about the
queen&#8217;s business, and I durst not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Good mother, tell me how, and let me do
it,&#8221; coaxed Francis. &#8220;I must get to my
father. O, if you have ever had a loved one,
for the sake of that one, give me the aid I ask.
I am but a girl. Weak and helpless with the
great queen and her ministers against me.
Yet I must warn my father. O dame, I lack
so little of being home. If I had a few
hours more, just a few hours! Please, good
mother,&#8221;&mdash;she paused, and flinging her arms
around the woman&#8217;s neck, she kissed her.
Dame Margery&#8217;s frame shook and she held the
girl close. Then she whispered, stroking her
hair softly:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My bonny maiden, thou shalt have thy
wish. For that kiss I would give thee anything.
It hath been years since Margery felt
the touch of fresh young lips. Men fear me,
and children shun me, but thou hast not.
Once more, child.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
</p>
<p>
Gratefully Francis kissed her; not once but
many times. Then the dame stole softly out,
and the girl followed her. To a corner cupboard
the old woman went, and taking out a
phial that held some dark mixture she held it
to the light for a second and shook it gently.
Then with that marvelous agility that had
caused Francis to wonder earlier in the evening
she glided among the sleeping men and
let fall a tiny drop of the decoction near the
nostrils of each slumberer. A sweet odor
filled the room so subtle and penetrating that
the girl beat a hasty retreat into the smaller
chamber, fearing that she too might be overcome
by it.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Come, child,&#8221; called Margery. &#8220;They
sleep as slept the seven sleepers of long ago.
And so they will sleep until the dawn. I dare
not give them more for fear of death. And
they are the queen&#8217;s men. Thou wilt have to
hasten, child. With these few hours&#8217; advantage
thou shouldst reach thy father in time.
The storm hath broken. Now thou must away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The storm had indeed passed. The rain
still fell, but gently. In the west a few stars
peeped between the rifts in the clouds.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;How can I ever repay thee?&#8221; whispered
Francis embracing the dame warmly. &#8220;Heaven
bless thee, mother. Farewell!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Farewell. Fear naught. Trust to the
guidance of thy horse and this lanthorne.
The night is dark, but the dawn comes early.
Ride now for thy life, girl. Farewell.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>AN UNLOOKED FOR RECEPTION</h3>
</div>

<p>
The night was dark as Dame Margery had
said. The broken clouds that flitted across the
sky obscured the faint light of the stars that
struggled to peep through the nebulous masses.
At another time the superstitious spirit of the
girl would have shrunk from the noises of the
wood, and found omens in the hoot of the
owl, or the moaning of the wind as it sobbed
fitfully through the trees. But now the
screech of the night bird and the soughing of
the wind fell upon deaf ears for she was so
absorbed in the one idea of getting home that
all else was unheeded.
</p>
<p>
In the darkness she was obliged to proceed
slowly, trusting rather to the instinct of the
horse than to the dim light of the lantern.
The dripping trees saturated her garments almost
as thoroughly as if it were indeed raining,
but the fire of filial love was in her heart,
and its flame rendered her impervious to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
creature discomforts. At length the dawn
came, and the sun&#8217;s bright beams soon dispersed
the mists of the night, his revivifying
rays inspiring the girl with new courage.
The horse, of his own volition, struck into a
brisker gait, and Francis was obliged to control
her emotion as each succeeding moment
brought her nearer the Hall.
</p>
<p>
Just before noon the turrets of Stafford Hall
came into view. With a cry of exultation
she spurred her horse forward.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;On, on!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Thy journey is almost
done!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
At full gallop she sped through the gates
and into the base court. Her father&#8217;s horse,
bridled and saddled, stood at the foot of the
steps leading to the terrace.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Mistress Francis,&#8221; cried Brooks, the old
servitor who held the horse, &#8220;how came you
here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My father?&#8221; gasped Francis as she sprang
to the ground.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;In the presence chamber, mistress. He&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>
She waited to hear no more, but ran up
the steps, through the ante-rooms, and bounded
into the presence chamber.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
</p>
<p>
Lord Stafford and his wife stood with their
arms twined about each other, as if in the act
of saying farewell. They started at her
entrance, the utmost surprise upon their faces
when they saw who the intruder was.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Father!&#8221; exclaimed Francis running to
him with outstretched arms. &#8220;Father!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Her father did not stir to meet her, but,
folding his arms, regarded her sternly.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;False girl,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;why come you
hither?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;To save thee, my father.&#8221; Francis paused
bewildered by his manner. &#8220;Father, they
accuse thee of treason. The queen&#8217;s men are
coming to take thee to the Tower. You must
fly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;And do you bid me fly? You who have
betrayed me? You whom I trusted? You
who vowed that not even the rack could extort
one syllable from your lips? Base girl,
is it thus that thou dost requite my love?
Away! Go back to that court whose enticements
have caused thee to betray thy father.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I betray thee?&#8221; cried Francis in horror.
&#8220;I, Francis Stafford, betray my father?
Never! Never!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Seek not to deny it, girl. One hath been
here from the court. I know that every incident
of the journey to Chartley, even to the
meeting with Babington at Salisbury, is
known to the queen. Who knew all this but
thee? Fool that I was to confide in thee!
But thou wert so cock-sure of thy ability! So
apt and froward with thy promises, that I believed
in thee.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My father, if there are those who say that
I betrayed thee, they speak not the truth. I
have come to warn thee of peril. Even now
the pursuivants are on their way to take thee.
Oh, sir! tarry no longer but fly. &#8217;Tis death
to be taken, father. Death!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
She wrung her hands as her father stood
there so unheedingly when time was so
precious.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;And if it be death, by whose hand hath it
been wrought? Why hast thou dallied at
court so long? Why dost thou still wear that
garb which shames thy modesty?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Father, hear me,&#8221; cried Francis, flinging
herself at his feet. &#8220;If ever thou didst bear
aught of affection to her that kneels to thee,
believe me when I say that I betrayed thee
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
not. May my tongue be palsied if I speak not
the truth. Father, by all the saints, I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;False girl, perjure not thy soul,&#8221; and he
strove to release himself from her grasp.
&#8220;Unclasp thine arms, Francis Stafford, and
hearken to a father&#8217;s curse. May&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Hold, my lord!&#8221; shrieked Lady Stafford.
&#8220;Curse not thy child! Curse not thine own
flesh and blood!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;No child is she of mine, madam. Rather
do I believe her some changeling forced upon
us by witches&#8217; craft. Never did Stafford betray
trust before! Stay me not! Whether
child or changeling yet still shall she be
cursed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Father, father, I am innocent of having
done this monstrous, wicked thing! &#8217;Twas
Anthony Babington that hath so maliciously
spoken about me! I know&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;How know you that &#8217;twas Babington?&#8221;
demanded her father quickly. &#8220;Girl, thine
own words condemn thee. Say no more! I
will listen to thy false words no longer. I
curse the day that thou wast born. I curse
thee&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Forbear,&#8221; shrieked the girl in agonized
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
tones. &#8220;O, father, withhold thy curse!
Hear me for the love of mercy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
But Lord Stafford tore himself from her
clinging hands, and hastily left the room.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Father,&#8221; cried Francis, darting after him.
&#8220;Father!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
He heeded her not, but strode out of the
castle to the place where old Brooks held his
horse.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Father, father!&#8221; The frantic girl reached
him as he mounted his steed and held out her
arms entreatingly. But the father answered
never a word, and without another look at
her gave spur to his horse, and dashed
through the open gates of the court.
</p>
<p>
Then a great cry of anguish broke from the
girl&#8217;s lips. A black mist rose before her eyes,
engulfing her in its choking, smothering embrace.
She swayed unsteadily and fell in an
unconscious heap upon the ground.

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>AS IT FELL OUT</h3>
</div>

<p>
When consciousness returned to Francis
Stafford she was lying on a couch in the presence
chamber with her mother bending over
her.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Mother,&#8221; she cried as a full realization of
all that had taken place rushed over her.
&#8220;He is gone! My father is gone, and he
hath cursed me!&#8221; And she burst into a flood
of tears.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Think not on it, child,&#8221; said the mother,
her own eyes streaming. &#8220;Thou didst try
him greatly. It was ill in thee not to return
to us, but thou art young and full well do I
ken the allurements that court life holds for
youth. But this thy father could have pardoned
had this been all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My mother, art thou too against me?&#8221;
The girl struggled to a sitting position,
her indignation giving her strength. &#8220;Dost
thou believe that I betrayed my father, or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
that I lingered at court from choice? Then
what avails it if I tell thee all? Am I not
thy child, and wherefore should I do so evil?
Would that I had died ere this had come
upon me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
She flung herself back upon the couch and
wept bitterly. Her mother, alarmed at the
intensity of her grief, strove to soothe
her.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Let me make my moan, mother. If my
father would have but listened, he would
have known that I did not betray him; but
he would not. He would not!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Judge him not too harshly, Francis. Now
tell me the cause of thy delay. Why thou
didst not send us word? Why thou didst not
return?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Who was there to do my bidding? I
would not have been here even yet had I not
heard the queen and her ministers planning
to arrest the conspirators. So soon as I heard
my father&#8217;s name I left the court without
leave, and came hither with all dispatch to
warn him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Tell me all, Francis,&#8221; urged her mother.
&#8220;All that hath happened thee from the beginning.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
I fear me much that thy father hath
done thee wrong.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;He hath,&#8221; said Francis bitterly. &#8220;Grievous
wrong! And as I live by bread, there hath
never been aught but love toward him in my
heart. But now&mdash;&mdash;Oh, my mother,&#8221; she
cried with another outburst of woe, &#8220;my heart
is broken!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;There, child! weep not so much. Thy
father will repent him of his injustice when
he learns the truth. Dry thine eyes and tell
all that hath befallen thee.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Presently, when she had become calmer,
Francis complied with the request, and told
her mother all that had occurred since she
left her.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;And thy hair! Thy pretty hair!&#8221; cried
Lady Stafford weeping when Francis related
that incident. &#8220;Ah, child, I repent me that
ever I consented to let thee leave me. But
continue, I pray thee! I would know all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
And the girl continued her narrative to its
close. Her mother clasped her close when she
finished it.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;We have done thee great wrong, my
daughter. Forgive me and thy father also.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
We should have known that thou wouldst not
have done this thing, but when we did not
hear, and thou didst not come, we marveled
at it greatly. This morning Anthony Babington
came, and told us that all was known
to the queen through thy treachery. And
thou must be lenient toward us that we believed
him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;But why didst thou, mother! Have I
been so ill a daughter that ye must believe
the first word against me? I can not forgive it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Not now, my child, while thy hurt is recent,
but later thy mother must not sue to
thee in vain. But, Francis, come to my tiring
room. I mislike that garb. Methinks it hath
caused all our woe. Come, and let me see
thee in thy proper attire once more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay;&#8221; said Francis resolutely, &#8220;from
this time forth I wear none other. &#8217;Twas at
my father&#8217;s bidding that I donned it. I will
discard it only when he calls me &#8216;daughter&#8217;
again. Otherwise I shall go to my grave
Francis Stafford, the page.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Francis, Francis,&#8221; wailed the lady, &#8220;thou
art distraught. Entertain not such purpose,
I entreat. Soften thy proud heart, and be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
not stubborn when thy mother pleads with
thee. For my sake, child, remove that dress.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay, mother;&#8221; replied she obdurately,
&#8220;seek not to change my purpose, for it is
fixed. This page&#8217;s dress I wear until my
father takes me once more to his heart.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Thou art as unyielding and inflexible as
thy sire,&#8221; cried her mother. &#8220;What can I
do between ye? Have thy way, thou wilful
girl! Naught remains for thy mother but to
pray that the day may be hastened when all
will be well with us again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Just then there came a clattering of hoofs
in the courtyard, and the sound of voices.
Lady Stafford sprang to her feet in alarm.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;What is it?&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Oh, child,
what if they have taken thy father?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;&#8217;Tis the queen&#8217;s men,&#8221; said Francis starting
up. &#8220;They seek my father, but they
seek in vain. I have foiled them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
A sense of exultation swept over her, causing
her to forget for the time her father&#8217;s distrust.
She faced the men who entered the apartment
triumphantly.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;What seek ye?&#8221; she demanded with
scorn.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Thy father, boy, and thee,&#8221; was the reply.
&#8220;We know that thou hast warned him so that
he hath given us the slip. But marry! the
game is but afoot, and we the greyhounds who
will bring him to bay. Of him anon. Here
is a warrant for one Francis Stafford. Art
thou he?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I am,&#8221; answered the girl haughtily.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Then, Francis Stafford, son of William,
Lord Stafford, in the name of the queen, I arrest
thee on a charge of high treason.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Arrest thee, Francis?&#8221; cried her mother
flinging her arms about the girl. &#8220;Oh, child,
why thee?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I was with my father at Chartley, mother,&#8221;
said Francis calmly. &#8220;If he be guilty of
treason, why, then so am I.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;But I knew not that thou wert in danger,&#8221;
sobbed the mother. &#8220;Oh, Francis, why didst
thou not go with thy father? Why didst thou
not tell him of it? Why, why?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I did not think of it,&#8221; answered Francis
simply. &#8220;I thought only of him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;How thou hast been misjudged,&#8221; exclaimed
the lady weeping bitterly. &#8220;Oh,
cruel, cruel fate that hath befallen thee!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Cease thy lamentation, woman,&#8221; commanded
the officer sternly. &#8220;Make ready to
accompany thy son to London.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My mother!&#8221; exclaimed Francis and her
mother in one breath.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Thou. Thou canst no longer remain here,
because this Hall and its estate are forfeited
to the crown by the treason of its owner. &#8217;Tis
the queen&#8217;s command that thou dost go with
thy son to London there to be immured in
the Tower. Make ready, madam. Ye two
must this hour to the queen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;But what crime have I committed?&#8221;
asked the poor lady in dismay.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I know not, madam. &#8217;Tis the queen&#8217;s
command,&#8221; was the reply.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;&#8217;Tis the worst of all crimes, my mother,&#8221;
said Francis with irony. &#8220;Thou art too fair.
&#8217;Tis a fault unforgivable by Elizabeth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Hush, child,&#8221; whispered the lady quickly.
&#8220;Make our sad plight no worse by thy railing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Stay, boy!&#8221; cried Wainwright as Francis
started to leave the apartment with her
mother. &#8220;Remain where thou art. I would
have speech with thee.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
</p>
<p>
Wonderingly, the girl paused, and Master
Wainwright, making a peremptory motion to
Lady Stafford to leave them, continued:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Thou art too elusive to be out of my sight,
young sir. Now answer these queries. Wert
thou in the dwelling of old Margery when we
entered it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Marry! what is it to thee where I was,&#8221;
answered Francis, desiring not to get the dame
into trouble.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Be not too pert, sir page. I wrung from
the old woman that thou wert, after I found
that we o&#8217;erslept. Now, boy, was it due to
thee or to the witch that we slept so long?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;To me, master,&#8221; replied the girl boldly.
&#8220;Upon my shoulders cast all blame. Impute
nothing to the old woman. I did all, for I
knew that I must distance thee to warn my
father. And thou wert outstripped! Thou
wert close after the game but he took to soil,
and the track is lost, good master.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Crow on, my bantam,&#8221; cried Wainwright
angrily. &#8220;Thou wilt sing another tune when
Sir Francis Walsingham hath thee. And
mark me, sirrah! The track will be regained,
and the game brought to cover ere thou dost
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
reach the Tower. Then upon Tower Hill thou
canst behold its breaking up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Francis turned pale as death at this reference
to what would be her father&#8217;s fate if
taken.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Ah, that hipped thee, young cock! Dost
ken what happens to traitors? &#8217;Twill be thy
fate as well as thy father&#8217;s. Dream on&#8217;t,
master! Now must you and your mother
take horse for London.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;To-day?&#8221; said Francis faintly, a sense of
weakness coming over her. &#8220;Oh, sir, not to-day,
beseech you. I have ridden so much.
I am so tired!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;This day shalt thou start,&#8221; said Wainwright
rejoicing with all the might of a small
man in the power over another. &#8220;No pleading
will avail thee. Thou must go!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;As you will then,&#8221; answered Francis
wearily, though every muscle in her tired
body rebelled at this further tax upon her
strength.
</p>
<p>
And so the long, weary journey to London
was again begun.

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>IN THE TOWER OF LONDON</h3>
</div>

<p>
It was a dreary journey. The motive which
had sustained the girl in her former trip from
the city to her home was lacking. The fatigue
incident to travel, the unjust reception
of her by her father, with the doubtfulness
of his escape, and the uncertainty of what
was to become of her mother and herself, now
bore upon her with such overwhelming force
as to almost crush even her brave spirit.
Lady Stafford suffered a like mental anguish,
and so, on account of the weakness of the two
prisoners, the guard was compelled to return
to the city by slow stages.
</p>
<p>
Upon their entrance within the gates they
found that the whole city was in an uproar,
caused by the apprehension of Anthony Babington
and several others of the conspirators.
Bells were ringing, bonfires burning and the
most vehement satisfaction expressed by the
people, who, with shouts and singing of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
psalms, gave every demonstration of joy at the
escape of the queen from their treasonable designs.
</p>
<p>
When it became known that these two were
also implicated, a hooting, jeering mob followed
them through the streets, hurling vile
epithets upon them, and taunting them with
their disgrace. Lady Stafford drooped under
the attack, but the assault roused the spirit in
Francis, and she sat erect, her flashing eyes
and contemptuous looks bespeaking the tempest
that raged in her heart.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Bear up, my mother,&#8221; she said to Lady
Stafford who could scarcely sit her horse.
&#8220;Give not the rabble cause to laugh and jibe.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;But, my child, that we of the house of
Stafford, be thus dishonored!&#8221; exclaimed the
lady in anguish. &#8220;Oh, I cannot bear it! I
cannot bear it! Carest thou not for this disgrace?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I could weep my heart out, if it would
avail aught,&#8221; uttered Francis in low, intense
tones. &#8220;Bethink you, mother, that this mob
of the streets shall see one tear from me?
Nay; &#8217;twould give them too much of pleasure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;And has it come to this? That thou
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
shouldst be an example to thy mother?&#8221;
asked the lady sitting up. &#8220;Let them rage!
Not another tear shall they behold. There
will be time enough for tears later.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
And so saying she followed her daughter&#8217;s
example and rode with uplifted head, apparently
indifferent to the taunts of the people
who followed them down to the waterside,
even to the wharf where they embarked for
the Tower.
</p>
<p>
Babington and his companions occupied
another boat which preceded them down the
river, and Francis felt relief when she saw
that her father was not among them. The
tide being in their favor, the boat passed
swiftly down the river, shot London Bridge,
and all too soon drew near the sombre mass
of the Tower.
</p>
<p>
In spite of her undaunted front Francis
could not forbear a shudder as their wherry
drew near Saint Thomas&#8217; tower. As a mere
matter of form the boats were challenged by
the sentinels. A wicket, composed of immense
beams of wood, was opened and they shot beneath
the gloomy arch, through the Traitors&#8217;
gate. A feeling of dread took possession of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
the girl as her gaze fell upon the slimy walls
of the dismal arch. The wherrymen ceased
rowing and the water rippled sullenly against
the sides of the boat which soon, impelled by
the former efforts of the oarsmen, touched the
steps.
</p>
<p>
The lieutenant of the Tower, followed by
numerous warders, appeared and gave acknowledgment
of their receipt to the guard.
Slowly the prisoners ascended the damp and
slippery steps, Francis and her mother being
the last to go up. A few quick commands
and Babington and the others were
hurried away, each man between two warders.
Then the lieutenant turned to Lady
Stafford.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Follow me, madam,&#8221; he said making a
respectful salutation. &#8220;I will conduct you to
your chamber, where, I pray your pardon, my
orders are to place you under some restraint.
You, young master, will remain here until my
return. The time will be but short.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Oh,&#8221; cried the lady in supplicating tones,
&#8220;are we to be separated?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Such are my commands, madam,&#8221; returned
he in tones of commiseration. &#8220;Thou art to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
be confined in the Brick Tower. Thy son in
the Beauchamp Tower. Come!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Oh, my child! my child!&#8221; sobbed the
mother throwing her arms about Francis.
&#8220;What will be thy fate? What will they do
to thee?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Calm thyself, my mother,&#8221; comforted
Francis. &#8220;We can but hope. Mayhap the
good keeper will permit us to see each other
occasionally. Go now, mother. We must
not vex him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Clasping her convulsively to her breast for
a moment, Lady Stafford released her, and
then followed the lieutenant, weeping bitterly.
</p>
<p>
Then Francis sat her down in the midst of
the warders upon that very stone where Elizabeth
had rested when she herself passed into
the Tower, a prisoner to the jealousy of her sister,
Mary. Soon the lieutenant returned and
said courteously:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;And now, master, be pleased to follow me
to your chamber.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Francis arose and followed him without a
word. Through the outer ward they passed
through the lofty portal which formed the
principal entrance to the inner ward over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
which rose a dismal-looking structure, then
called the Garden Tower, but later known as
the Bloody Tower. Passing beneath these
grim portals the lieutenant led his prisoner
into the inner ward, over the Tower Green,
and at last paused before an embattled structure
of the time of King John, just opposite the
great keep, or the White Tower. Ascending
the circular stairway, he unlocked the double
doors that led into the tower, and they
passed into a large, low-roofed dark apartment
that held a very scanty array of furniture.
Then he withdrew, the bolt clasped, the chain
clanged, and Francis was left alone.
</p>
<p>
A sense of desolation swept over the girl
as the full realization of the situation burst
upon her, and the blackness of despair filled
her soul with anguish. She was alone. She
had no one to lean upon. No ear to which
she could impart her sorrows. Her mother a
prisoner like herself. Her father&mdash;a fugitive
wandering she knew not whither. As the
bitterness of her lot assailed her in all its
force she could no longer control herself but
gave way to a passionate burst of grief. She
looked at the stone walls by which she was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
enclosed, the massive iron-girded door and
the hopelessness of her situation bore with
crushing weight upon her.
</p>
<p>
There was no eye to see, no longer need
for control, and she gave vent to her despair
unrestrainedly. At length the fountain
of her tears was dry, and becoming
more composed she sought to regain her
fortitude.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I have done no wrong,&#8221; she said aloud.
&#8220;No wrong? Was it wrong to give those
letters to Mary? But my father bade me.
My father! Ah, no word of that must pass
my lips. Cruel and unjust he hath been, but
never shall word or act of mine bear witness
against him. I must fortify my soul for I fear
that I will be questioned.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Her foreboding proved true. Early the
next morning the door leading into the chamber
was opened, and Sir Francis Walsingham
with two others entered. Francis&#8217; heart sank
at sight of them, but she nerved herself for
the ordeal.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Good-morrow, Master Stafford,&#8221; said the
secretary courteously. &#8220;We give you good-morrow.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Good-morrow, Sir Francis. And to you,
gentlemen, good-morrow,&#8221; returned she.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My lad,&#8221; said Walsingham not unkindly,
seating himself before her, &#8220;thou art charged
with a heinous crime, and methinks that thou
art too young to be concerned in such weighty
matters. Therefore, am I with these lords,
come to examine thee somewhat anent it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;With what am I charged, sir?&#8221; asked
Francis.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;With that most atrocious of all crimes,&mdash;treason,&#8221;
was the reply.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My lord, I meant not to be guilty of treason
against the queen,&#8221; said the girl earnestly.
&#8220;If aught that I have done seemeth so in her
eyes, believe me I pray you, when I say that it
was not so intended.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I do believe it,&#8221; answered the secretary.
&#8220;I think that thou hast been made use of by
others to further design of bold and unscrupulous
men. Didst thou ever meet with Anthony
Babington?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Yes, Sir Francis.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Where?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Once at Salisbury, and once in the forest
as I left London.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;What passed at those meetings?&#8221; Walsingham
drew closer, expecting from the girl&#8217;s
demeanor to find ready answers to his inquiries.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I cannot tell you, sir, of the nature of the
first,&#8221; answered Francis. &#8220;I will gladly do
so of the second.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Relate it then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;He was trying to make his escape when
his design upon the queen became known.
He sprang upon me when I was unaware,
seized the bridle of my horse, and demanded
that I give the animal to him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Which you refused?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Which I refused to do, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Did he recognize you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;And you him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Yes, Sir Francis.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Did you know that he was trying to escape
from arrest?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Yes;&#8221; answered Francis again.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Then why did you not let him have the
horse?&#8221; queried Walsingham.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Because I wished to reach my father,&#8221; replied
the girl simply.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;But why did you want to reach your
father?&#8221; and the secretary bent forward.
&#8220;How knew you that he was in danger?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Why, I heard you tell the queen that you
were going to arrest him, and I wished to
warn him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Thou heardst me tell the queen?&#8221; cried
the minister in surprise. &#8220;Boy, how couldst
thou? We were in the queen&#8217;s own chamber.
How couldst thou hear it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I went there to seek a favor from Her
Majesty, and awaited her coming upon the
balcony outside the window. When the
queen entered, the vice-chamberlain, Lord
Burleigh, my Lord of Leicester, and yourself
were with her. I feared then to come into
the room. Thus I could but hear all that
passed. When I found that my father was in
danger I left the balcony and the palace as
quickly, determined to warn him of his
peril.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Then you knew that he was concerned in
the plot to kill the queen?&#8221; and Walsingham
eyed her keenly.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;He was not,&#8221; cried the girl eagerly.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Then why should he flee?&#8221; asked the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
merciless inquisitor. &#8220;No peer of the realm
hath aught to fear if he be innocent of foul
design.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Francis was so disconcerted by this question
that she did not attempt to reply, but looked
at him hopelessly.
</p>
<p>
The wily minister saw her confusion and
pressed his advantage.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Thou needest not to answer, boy, on the
condition that thou tell to me all that passed
the first time that you saw Babington.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I cannot do that, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;&#8217;Twill be the better for thee,&#8221; warned the
secretary. &#8220;We have knowledge that thou
and thy father did meet with Babington at
an inn in Salisbury. For thine own sake,
thou wouldst best reveal what took place.
Reflect! Thine own safety depends upon it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I will not tell, Sir Francis,&#8221; returned
Francis bravely.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Have a care, boy. There are ways of extorting
confessions from unwilling lips.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I do not misunderstand your meaning,&#8221;
returned the girl with white lips, &#8220;but I cannot
tell.&#8221;

</p>
<p>
&#8220;What did your father when the proposition
was made to kill the queen?&#8221; asked
Walsingham so suddenly that Francis was
caught unawares.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;He would have naught to do with it,&#8221;
answered she promptly, glad to speak in his
favor. &#8220;He rejected it with horror.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Ah, ha! he did know of it!&#8221; ejaculated
the secretary. &#8220;Thou hast betrayed thyself.
Come! Let us have the full particulars.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Sir,&#8221; said Francis, perceiving the snare
into which she had fallen, &#8220;I am unable to
meet your craft with like guile. Therefore
question me no further. I will say no more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
And despite all attempts to trip her into
answering, she maintained an obstinate silence
with regard to all their questions.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Let us leave him,&#8221; said Walsingham at
length. &#8220;Obdurate lad, thou wilt regret thy
stubbornness ere long. There are other means
of dealing with such spirits than gentleness.
We will return ere long, and if thou art still of
the same mind, thou shalt taste them.&#8221; And
he withdrew, leaving Francis to face this new
trial.

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>A FRIEND IN NEED</h3>
</div>

<p>
It was with much apprehension that Francis
awaited the return of the secretary. Stories
that she had heard regarding the tortures inflicted
upon prisoners in the Tower came to
her mind with such vividness and force as to
cause her soul to sicken with fear.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I must not think on them,&#8221; she said, trying
to drive this terror from her mind. For
diversion she arose and examined the inscriptions
in the room. &#8220;How many there have
been before me!&#8221; she mused gazing at the
coats of arms and other devices with which
the walls were covered. &#8220;What melancholy
memorials of illustrious and unfortunate people!
Here is the name of the Earl of Arundel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
She looked long and earnestly at the autograph
of that unhappy nobleman, Phillip
Howard, Earl of Arundel, who was beheaded
for aspiring to the hand of Mary Stuart.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
This name was written boldly over the fireplace,
and the girl turned from it with a sigh
as the thought occurred to her that all who
were connected in any manner with that ill-starred
princess must meet with some untoward
fate.
</p>
<p>
She passed with a shudder from the next
inscription bearing the recent date of 1582,
which read:
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto; '>
<tr><td><p style='margin-top:0.5em; margin-bottom:0.0em'>
&#8220;Thomas Miagh which liethe here alone
</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p style='margin-left:.5em; margin-top:0.0em; margin-bottom:0.0em'>

</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p style='margin-left:.5em; margin-top:0.0em; margin-bottom:0.5em'>
Yet of my liberty denied;&#8221;
</p></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
for that &#8220;torture straunge&#8221; suggested
thoughts of too painful a nature to dwell
upon. The next bore the date, &#8220;Anno D.
1571, 10 Sept., and read:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;The most unhappy man in the world is
he that is not patient in adversities; for men
are not killed with the adversities they have,
but with the impatience they suffer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
And so she went from one to another, marveling
at the resignation, patience and endurance
breathed by many of the inscriptions,
and shuddering at the thought of those
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
&#8220;straunge tortures&#8221; which were hinted at by
others.
</p>
<p>
Three days elapsed. On the morning of
the fourth day, as Francis sat listlessly awaiting
the coming of her jailer with her noonday
meal, which was the only diversion that
her prison life afforded, the door opened to admit,
not her keeper, but Sir Francis Walsingham
and two warders. Every particle of
color left her face at sight of him, and she
uttered a silent prayer for help as she arose in
response to his greeting.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Well, young master, I hope that I find
you in a more amiable frame of mind to-day?&#8221;
half questioned, half asserted the secretary.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Sir,&#8221; replied she, &#8220;I am of the same
opinion as heretofore. I confess that if to
carry letters to Mary, Queen of Scots, be
treason, then am I guilty of rebellion against
the queen&#8217;s highness. Therefore, adjudge me
guilty, and give me, I beseech you, a speedy
death. But, if the word of one who stands
in peril of life may be taken, I solemnly declare
that my father is innocent of all design
of harming the Queen of England.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;That declaration, boy, will not save him,&#8221;
replied Walsingham sternly. &#8220;By not revealing
the conspiracy, if he knew of it, he
acquiesced in it. His first duty was to his
sovereign. I now ask you for the last time
with gentleness, in the name of the queen,
did he know of it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Francis remained silent.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;&#8217;Tis enough,&#8221; said the minister sternly.
&#8220;&#8217;Tis the law that he who refuses to answer a
query put in the queen&#8217;s name, may be questioned
in a far sharper manner. Bring him
along, wardens.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;There is no need,&#8221; said Francis with dignity
as the two advanced toward her. &#8220;I
will attend without force.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The wardens bowed and opening the door
of the chamber, ushered her into the corridor.
Traversing this for a short distance they came
to a flight of steps which they descended.
Here they were confronted by a strong door
which one of the men opened. It admitted
them to a dark, narrow passage of considerable
extent so far as could be discerned. After
pursuing a direct course for some time they
came to an opening on the left, into which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
they struck. This hall was so narrow that
they were obliged to walk singly. The roof
was clustered with nitrous drops and the floor
was slippery with moisture.
</p>
<p>
Francis did not know what part of the
Tower she was in but she had heard that the
whole substructure of the fortress was
threaded with subterranean passages which
led to different parts of the edifice. This particular
one was contrived in the thickness of
the ballium wall which led from Beauchamp
Tower to Develin Tower. On either side of the
corridor was a range of low, strong doors which
gave entrance to dungeons, and horrible
thoughts of what the inmates of these
noisome cells must endure flashed across the
girl&#8217;s mind, rendering her faint and sick.
</p>
<p>
At the end of the passage was an open door
leading to a small circular chamber which the
four entered and the door was closed. Francis
gave one quick glance around her and her
senses reeled for the room was one of the torture
chambers of the Tower.
</p>
<p>
On the ground was a large brazier beside
which lay an immense pair of pincers. In
one corner stood a great oaken frame about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
three feet high moved by rollers. This was
the rack. Upon the wall hung a broad hoop
of iron opening in the centre with a hinge&mdash;a
dreadful instrument of torture called the
Scavenger&#8217;s daughter. The walls and floor
were covered with gauntlets, saws and other
implements of torture, but the rack caught
and held her eyes with terrible fascination.
</p>
<p>
Walsingham seated himself at a small table
upon which were writing materials, and turning
to Francis said earnestly,
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Gaze about thee, boy, and reflect upon
what thou seest. There is yet time to tell all
that thou knowest. Think well ere thou dost
doom thy tender limbs to the rack.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The perspiration started forth in great drops
upon the girl&#8217;s forehead. Her trembling lips
could scarcely frame her utterance as she
answered:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Do to me as ye list, Sir Francis. I will
not speak further concerning my father.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
With an exclamation of impatience the secretary
made a sign. From behind a stone
pillar there stepped forth a man at whose appearance
Francis could not forbear a scream.
He was tall and very attenuated, clothed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
wholly in black. His face thin and sinister
was of a pale sickly color while his eyes, black
and glittering, held the gaze with a basilisk
glare. He was the sworn tormentor of the
Tower.
</p>
<p>
Francis shrieked at sight of him, striving in
vain to control her terror. Just as the torturer
reached her side the door was flung open
and a warder, accompanied by Lord Shrope,
burst into the room.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Sir Francis, Sir Francis,&#8221; cried Lord
Shrope in agitated accents, &#8220;for the love of
mercy, forbear!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My lord,&#8221; cried Walsingham starting up,
&#8220;what means this intrusion?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;It means, sir, that for thy honor&#8217;s sake,
for the love which thou bearest thine own fair
daughter, I implore you to desist. Wouldst
thou subject a maiden to the rack?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;A what, my lord?&#8221; cried the secretary
aghast.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;A maiden,&#8221; repeated Lord Shrope. &#8220;Francis
Stafford is not the son but the daughter of
Lord Stafford.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Then, in the name of St. George, why this
disguise?&#8221; asked the secretary.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Tell him, child,&#8221; commanded the nobleman,
but Francis clung to him convulsively,
unable to speak. Seeing her condition, Lord
Shrope related the matter hurriedly, concluding
with:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I knew that you knew not her sex, Walsingham,
so I sought you to inform you anent
it. Learning that you had come here, and
fearing that this step would be taken, for well
do I ken the stubbornness of the girl where
her father is concerned, I hastened hither.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;But, my lord, if this act be foregone how
shall we proceed? Thou knowest well all
evidence that can be obtained anent every one
implicated with that &#8216;bosom serpent, Mary,&#8217;
should be gotten wil or nil.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My Lord of Burleigh is seeking you,&#8221;
said Lord Shrope. &#8220;He reporteth that Babington
hath made full confession, and hath
thrown himself upon the mercy of the
queen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Say you so?&#8221; Walsingham started for the
door, and then paused. &#8220;Thy services will
not be needed to-day,&#8221; he said to the tormentor.
&#8220;As for thee,&#8221; turning to Francis,
&#8220;thy sex protects thee from torture, but in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
sooth I wonder that one so young should be
so staunch.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Wouldst thou have a daughter speak
aught that would go against her father?&#8221;
asked Francis finding her voice at last.
&#8220;Nay; &#8217;twas cruel to expect it even though I
were in truth my father&#8217;s son.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Yet still it hath been done,&#8221; answered the
secretary.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Perchance thou wilt be more fortunate
than I in informing Her Majesty of the
matter,&#8221; suggested Lord Shrope. &#8220;Thou hast
her ear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;True, my lord; yet what would it avail?
The queen is not disposed to be lenient now
since the design upon her life was so nearly
successful. She would grant the maiden
proper attire, I trow, but no more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I do not wish other garb than this,&#8221; interposed
the girl. &#8220;None shall give it me
save my father.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Then must the matter drop,&#8221; said Walsingham.
&#8220;Damsel, I will speak to the lieutenant
of the Tower, and thou shalt have other
lodgings but more clemency thou must not
expect.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I crave none, sir,&#8221; answered Francis.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My lord, will you come with me, or go
with the girl?&#8221; queried the secretary.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;With you, Sir Francis. I dare not stay,&#8221;
whispered Lord Shrope. &#8220;Later, if I may, I
will see thee, child. It would not do now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
And with a friendly pressure of her hands
he followed after the minister while Francis
was conducted back to her prison.

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>A GREAT SORROW BEFALLS FRANCIS</h3>
</div>

<p>
And now began a weary time for Francis
Stafford. Some hope had crept into her heart
after she had seen Lord Shrope, but as the
days went by and she heard nothing from him
she felt once more friendless and hopeless.
</p>
<p>
At first her jailer would have nothing to
say to her and brought her food and drink,
maintaining the strictest silence. As the girl
became pale and worn from her confinement
he softened visibly. So much so that Francis
began anew her pleadings with him to give
her some tidings of her mother.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;It is forbid to talk much with prisoners,&#8221;
said the man gruffly, yet not unkindly, &#8220;but
I see no harm in telling thee that thy mother
hath been moved nearer to thee.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nearer?&#8221; cried Francis joyfully. &#8220;Oh,
good warder, pray you, where?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;She hath been taken to the Bell Tower
which lieth directly south of this tower,&#8221;
answered the keeper.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;So near?&#8221; murmured Francis. &#8220;That is
welcome tidings, good jailer. Prithee tell
me but one thing more. How bears she the
confinement?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay, master; that I cannot answer. I am
not her keeper, and therefore know naught of
her condition.&#8221; This he said compassionately
for it was known to the warder and other
officials of the Tower that Lady Stafford was
failing fast under her imprisonment which
was the reason of her removal to other quarters.
</p>
<p>
Not being aware of this fact Francis felt
happier at the near proximity of her mother,
and applied herself earnestly to the books
which the jailer had brought at her solicitation.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;How Hugh Greville would rejoice could
he but know what pleasure these give me,&#8221;
she murmured one day looking up from the
volume she held in her hand. &#8220;And truly I
never knew before the delights to be found in
learning. If I continue I may become as
learned as Lady Jane&mdash;&mdash;Marry! was she
not confined in this very room?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Rising hastily she went to the wall that lay
between the two recesses upon the left-hand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
side of the chamber and looked at the name
carved there: <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Iane</span>.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Whom could it mean but that unhappy
lady,&#8221; she mused. &#8220;Perchance it is her spirit
that haunts this gloomy abode and inspires
me to studious thoughts. It must be that she
too was immured in this room. If my grim
keeper prove amiable I will ask him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
But the keeper soon deprived her of this
comfort, small though it was.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay;&#8221; he said in answer to her inquiry.
&#8220;The Lady Jane was not kept here. That was
written by either her husband or one of his
brothers who were imprisoned in this place.
Know you not that only male prisoners are
incarcerated in the Beauchamp Tower? Look
about at those inscriptions, and thou wilt see
that none of them belong to women&mdash;save and
except that one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;True;&#8221; said Francis meditatively. &#8220;I
had not observed that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
She relapsed into thought and the keeper
withdrew. Francis cared no more for the
signature. It had been something of a solace
to think that she was occupying the same
room as that used by the hapless Jane; so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
small a thing does it take to comfort one in
such circumstances.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I&#8217;ll carve my own name,&#8221; she resolved
suddenly. &#8220;And then there will be one
woman amongst them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Taking her dagger from her belt, for that had
been left to her, she began to cut her name as
best she could upon the stone. It was an
interesting occupation, and she was amazed to
find how quickly the time sped while she was
so engaged. The keeper smiled when he
found her so intent upon her self-imposed task
that she did not heed his entrance.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;They all do it,&#8221; he remarked grimly.
&#8220;Albeit thou hast waited longer than some.
But eat, my master. There will be time and
to spare for finishing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;You speak truly,&#8221; assented the girl almost
cheerfully for the mere distraction of her
thoughts served to raise her spirits. &#8220;Truly;
and for that cause I will teach my hand to
move more slowly so that it will take a long,
long time. And I trow it will for the stone is
very hard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
But despite her best efforts the name grew
all too quickly, and, as many another had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
done before her, she grieved when her toil was
ended.
</p>
<p style='text-align: center'>
<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Francis Stafford</span>,
</p>
<p style='text-align: center'>
1586
</p>
<p>
was the inscription which she had carved below
that of <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Iane</span>. A feeling of deep depression
now took possession of her that even her
books failed to dispel.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;If I could but see my mother,&#8221; she said
pleadingly to the jailor. &#8220;Do you not think,
good sir, that I might? Let me speak to
the lieutenant. Surely he will not refuse
me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Thou mayst see her soon,&#8221; said the jailor
with such a note of kindness in his voice that
she looked up startled. &#8220;Meseems there is
some talk of permitting it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Is there aught amiss?&#8221; asked she tremblingly.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay; why should there be?&#8221; queried the
keeper evasively. &#8220;This day perished more
of the conspirators against the queen. Making
fourteen in all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Was my father among them?&#8221; Francis
gasped rather than asked the question.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;No, boy; he hath not been apprehended,
and it is thought that he hath escaped into
France.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Oh, if it be in truth so. I care not then for
aught else,&#8221; murmured Francis.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Then rest in peace; for of a certainty he
hath not been taken, and thou wilt have dire
need for all thy fortitude,&#8221; and with these
mysterious words he hastily quitted the room.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;What meant he?&#8221; asked Francis apprehensively.
&#8220;What could he mean? What
could befall me now? Perchance he meant
that life would be demanded next. But no;
the veriest wretch hath time given for preparation.
Then why not I?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
She paced the floor restlessly unable to rid
herself of the misgivings that were creeping
over her. It was customary for the warder to
lock her within one of the small cells that
adjoined the larger chamber for greater security
at night, but as the usual time passed and he
did not come her uneasiness increased.
</p>
<p>
At last the key grated in the lock, and the
door swung open to admit the lieutenant of
the Tower and a warder.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Be not alarmed, master,&#8221; said the lieutenant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
courteously. &#8220;We are come to take thee
to thy mother.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;What hath happened? Why come you
at night to take me to her?&#8221; demanded
Francis.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Be brave, and I will tell thee. Thy mother
hath not been well for some time and is failing
fast. We fear that she will not live much
longer. For that cause, and because it is her
desire, are we taking thee to her. Nay; there
is no time for lamentation now, boy. Bear
thyself like a man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
For a moment Francis leaned on him heavily
almost stunned by the information.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Courage, lad. Far better death than the
slow lingering of years in these grim walls.
Many have entered here younger and fairer
than she, and endured worse than death in a
lifetime imprisonment. Grieve not, but the
rather rejoice that she will be freed from sorrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Peace!&#8221; cried Francis, her soul full of bitterness.
&#8220;Peace! and lead me to my mother.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The lieutenant, without further speech, led
the way across the Tower Green to the southwestern
angle of the inner ballium where his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
own lodgings adjoined the Bell Tower. Kept
a close prisoner for more than two months, at
another time Francis would have been overpowered
with joy at finding herself once more
in the open air. But now the breeze fanned
her cheeks unnoticed. She followed after the
warder, who lighted the way with a torch, seeing
and heeding nothing.
</p>
<p>
The short distance was soon traversed. Entering
the lieutenant&#8217;s lodgings they passed
into a long gallery leading in a westerly direction
and were soon in the upper chamber of
the Bell Tower. This was the room occupied
by Elizabeth at the time of her incarceration
during her sister Mary&#8217;s reign. That it had
been the abode of royalty was the last thought
that occurred to Francis Stafford. It held but
one thing for her, which was the emaciated
form of her mother who lay upon the
bed.
</p>
<p>
With an exclamation of joy Lady Stafford
tried to hold out her hands to her daughter,
but dropped them weakly on her breast. Too
moved to speak Francis could only clasp her
close as if she could never let her go.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My daughter! My daughter!&#8221; murmured
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
the mother feebly. &#8220;At last I have thee, hold
thee again!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My mother!&#8221; uttered the girl brokenly.
&#8220;My mother!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Does she wander?&#8221; whispered the lieutenant
to the physician. &#8220;Didst thou hear
her say &#8216;daughter&#8217;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Yea; but her mind is clear. She is weak
but not distraught.&#8221; And the physician
looked at the dying woman earnestly.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Will she last long?&#8221; queried Sir Michael,
the lieutenant, and the physician answered
slowly:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay; her life may go out at any moment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
As in a dream Francis heard both questions
and answers, but did not comprehend their
import. Presently her mother spoke:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Francis, I am dying.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay;&#8221; broke from the girl passionately.
&#8220;Not now, mother. Not when we have just
found each other again. You must not, shall
not die.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Hush, child! We must not spend the
time in woe. I want you to promise me that
never again will you be connected with plot
against the queen. Promise me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;She hath killed thee,&#8221; burst from Francis
wildly. &#8220;Killed thee, my mother, and driven
my father forth a fugitive. Oh, I hate her!
I hate her!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Hush, oh hush!&#8221; wailed the mother, a
look of fear crossing her face as the lieutenant
and the physician started forward at the girl&#8217;s
words. &#8220;Good masters, heed her not. She is
distraught with grief. I&mdash;Francis&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>
She threw out her arms and strove to clasp
her daughter, but they fell to her side. A
swift pallor spread over her face, a gasping,
choking sound rattled noisily, and she was
dead. For a moment the girl seemed dazed
by what had happened, and then she threw
herself upon her mother with a wild shriek.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Mother, mother, speak to me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Thy mother is dead,&#8221; said the physician
trying to draw her away.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Touch me not,&#8221; she cried in frenzied accents
turning upon him so fiercely that involuntarily
he recoiled. &#8220;Minion! leave me.
Leave me with my mother.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;That may not be, my child,&#8221; said the
physician gently noting the wild light of her
eyes. &#8220;That may not be. The queen&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;The queen?&#8221; cried the girl shrilly.
&#8220;Yes; the queen! England&#8217;s great queen!
Oh, she is truly great! &#8217;Tis a crime to be
fairer than the queen! Ha, ha! a great
queen! Truly a great queen!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Girl or boy, whiche&#8217;er you be, cease such
words,&#8221; commanded the lieutenant sternly.
&#8220;Thou utterest treason.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Treason? Ay, sir, treason! Treason for
thee, but not for me. I claim no queen but
Mary of Scotland. I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Mary of Scotland hath been condemned to
death. She will be executed as soon as Elizabeth
signs the death warrant.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;To die?&#8221; shrieked the girl. &#8220;Mary to
die! If Mary must die, then shall Elizabeth
also. Nay; stay me not! I go to kill the
queen!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
She drew her poniard and made a dash for
the door; but the lieutenant caught her ere
she reached it.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Unhand me, varlet,&#8221; she panted. &#8220;Ye
shall not stay me from my purpose.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Girl, do you utter such words in the presence
of the dead? Look on thy mother and
say if still thou dost hold to thy design?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
</p>
<p>
He turned her forcibly toward her mother&#8217;s
form on the couch. Francis pressed a hand to
her brow as though bewildered, and then as if
drawn by that still calm face drew closer, and
gazed steadfastly upon it. The sweet sereneness
of the dead calmed her. Presently a sob
convulsed her frame, and flinging herself
upon the body she burst into a passion of
weeping.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Let her weep,&#8221; observed the physician.
&#8220;&#8217;Tis all that hath kept her from becoming
completely distraught.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I will send a woman to her,&#8221; said the
lieutenant. &#8220;The girl, if so she be, and no
boy would rave so, hath been too long alone.
We are but rude nurses for such sorrow.
Truly it grieves me that one so young should
meet with so much of misery.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
And he left the apartment.

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3>A FELLOW PRISONER</h3>
</div>

<p>
A merciful illness prostrated Francis for
many weeks, and when at length she crept
slowly toward health, the winter had passed
and spring was abroad in the land. Her convalescence
was tedious, owing to a settled melancholy
utterly unlike her usual buoyant disposition,
which had taken possession of her.
Upon one point only did a gleam of her native
spirit flash forth. This was when Mrs. Shelton,
the wife of one of the keepers, brought
her the apparel suitable to her sex.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay; vex me not with them, good mistress,&#8221;
exclaimed Francis. &#8220;&#8217;Twas by my
father&#8217;s command that I donned this attire,
and, by my faith, I will exchange it for no
other until he bids me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;That may be never, Mistress Stafford,&#8221; retorted
the woman impatiently. &#8220;Thou mayst
never see him again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Then will I wear it to my grave,&#8221; was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
Francis&#8217; answer. &#8220;I am fixed in this resolve,
Mistress Shelton, and naught can turn me
from it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;As ye please then,&#8221; quoth the dame. &#8220;Full
surely thou art as stubborn a lady as it hath
ever been my hap to see. But if ye will not,
ye will not;&#8221; and she took the garments away.
</p>
<p>
Francis now occupied her mother&#8217;s apartment
in the Bell Tower, and because of this
fact found a curious contentment in it.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;It may be that her spirit lingers here loth
to leave me alone,&#8221; she thought, and she took
to watching for a sign that such was the case.
</p>
<p>
She was roused from this dangerous train
of thought by Mrs. Shelton appearing before
her one day with a basket of figs. The girl
uttered an exclamation of delight at sight of
them, so small a thing does it take to arouse
interest sometimes.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;For me?&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Whence came they?
Who could have sent them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Ask me not, mistress. I know naught of
them save that they came from without the
gates of the Tower. Sir Michael searched the
basket, and as there was nothing but the fruit,
he let it pass.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Who could have sent them?&#8221; murmured
Francis, again in ecstasy. It was so sweet not
to be forgotten. To know that some one still
remembered her. &#8220;Could it be my father?
Nay; he would not dare. Lord Shrope? Yea;
it must have been he. Good, kind friend that
he is!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
From this time forward her recovery was
rapid. And when the following month brought
a bouquet of sweet smelling flowers, the third,
a basket of cherries, her joy knew no bounds.
Thereafter no month went by without some
token reaching her from that unknown person
who seemed so full of sweet remembrance of
her.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Now blessings be upon his head who hath
so much of thought for me,&#8221; she exclaimed
rapturously as a guitar took the place of fruit
or flowers. &#8220;No more shall I be lonely with
such companion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
And so with books, guitar, and an occasional
walk in the gardens of the lieutenant where
she went to take the air, Francis passed her
time not unhappily. She was upheld by the
thought that she was not forgotten. Thus
summer passed into fall; fall into winter, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
winter in turn gave way to spring, to that
memorable spring of 1588 when all England
was stirred by the rumor of the threatened
invasion of Spain. At this time the gifts to
Francis ceased, and such an important part of
her existence had they become that their stoppage
grieved her more than the threats of the
invasion.
</p>
<p>
Books and music lost interest, and she took
to watching the comings and goings of prisoners
through the grated loop-hole overlooking
the south ward through which all personages
must pass to reach the Garden Tower
which was over the principal entrance to the
inner ward. One day while thus engaged
she uttered an ejaculation and bent forward
to take a nearer view of a prisoner who was
just brought within by way of the Byward
Tower through which lay the main gate to the
Tower. This was used from Tower Hill and
by royalty when the Tower was used as a
castle.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;What is it, deary?&#8221; asked Mrs. Shelton,
who was in the chamber.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Edward Devereaux,&#8221; answered the girl
excitedly. &#8220;Now why hath he been sent here?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
Gramercy! methought none of the pages stood
higher in the queen&#8217;s favor than he.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;&#8217;Tis past knowing,&#8221; remarked the woman
in a matter-of-fact tone. &#8220;He who stands high
with the queen to-day, to-morrow may be beheaded
on Tower Hill. Marry! &#8217;tis better to
be one of the people, for they are held dear by
the queen. Beseems that Her Grace cares
naught for the courtiers. They are always
being sent here, either to be held in durance
for life, else to be beheaded. I am glad that
I am not of the court.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Francis did not heed her words, but was so
excited at beholding a face that she knew that
she leaned forward as far as she could, calling
loudly:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Edward! Edward Devereaux!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The youth looked up, but the girl was uncertain
as to whether he saw her or not. Mrs. Shelton
hurried forward at the sound of her voice.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Child!&#8221; she cried pulling her forcibly
from the window, &#8220;dost want to be taken elsewhere
and lodged? There are other towers
far gloomier than this, and if thou carest not
to taste their shadows thou wilt be more circumspect.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Thy pardon, mistress,&#8221; said Francis recovering
her self-possession. &#8220;I meant not to
transgress, &#8217;tis the first time since I saw my
mother that I have looked upon a face that
was known to me. I could not but greet him,
e&#8217;en though he be mine enemy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Thine enemy?&#8221; said the woman curiously.
&#8220;How now, mistress? Tell me the tale.
&#8217;Twill speed the hour and, forsooth, there is
need of entertainment here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Thus adjured Francis related the story of
the shooting of the deer; the incident of the
duel; spoke of the enmity that had always
existed between the families of Staffords and
Devereaux; narrated how Edward had favored
her when the Lady Priscilla Rutland had
stolen her hair; concluding with:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Therefore, thou seest, good Mistress Shelton,
that there can be naught but enmity betwixt
us twain. He hath done me service, &#8217;tis
true, and otherwise is a proper youth, I dare
say. Yet still he is mine enemy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;&#8216;Yet still he is mine enemy,&#8217;&#8221; mocked
Mrs. Shelton. &#8220;Marry, girl! &#8217;Tis marvelous
hate that thou showest when thou dost call
to him when he hath been brought into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
durance. &#8216;Yet still he is mine enemy.&#8217;&#8221;
She laughed.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Make merry, an ye will, mistress,&#8221; said
Francis, &#8220;but still is it as I tell ye.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;There, child! I meant not to vex thee,&#8221;
appeased the woman who had grown fond of
Francis, so long had she been in her keeping.
&#8220;I must learn more of the lad.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Do find why he hath been committed,&#8221;
cried the girl eagerly. &#8220;I can but wonder at
it. Hath he too been engaged in treasonable
enterprise&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay;&#8221; interrupted Mrs. Shelton, &#8220;for then
he would have entered under the tower of St.
Thomas through the Traitor&#8217;s Gate.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
In a few days she reported to Francis that
the charge against him was a nominal one.
He seemed to be committed only to be restrained
of his liberty and was given the privilege
of the Tower, wandering through the
wards at pleasure save only that he could not
pass the outer walls of the fortress.
</p>
<p>
And so it happened one day that when
Francis, attended by Mrs. Shelton, was taking
the air in the lieutenant&#8217;s garden Edward
Devereaux chanced to be walking there also.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
Seeing them he doffed his bonnet and approached,
deferentially speaking to Mrs.
Shelton:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Gracious madam, may I be permitted to
speak with your charge?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;It is not the custom for one prisoner to
hold converse with another, young sir,&#8221; replied
Mrs. Shelton. &#8220;But, as ye are enemies,
I will indulge thy request, albeit ye speak that
I may hear all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I thank you, madam, for your courtesy,&#8221;
replied the youth bowing. &#8220;Mistress Francis,
how fare you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Well, Master Devereaux,&#8221; answered Francis.
&#8220;That is,&#8221; she added, &#8220;as well as one
may fare who rests under the displeasure of
the queen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;You say truly,&#8221; sighed Devereaux. &#8220;Yet,
me thinks that to be under the queen&#8217;s displeasure
brings not more ill than to stand high
in her grace.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;What mean you, Master Devereaux?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Why, truly, you lie under her ill will, and
so abide in this grim fortress; while I, who
am her favorite page, do dwell in the same
place.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;But wherefore?&#8221; asked Francis. &#8220;Of
what crime hast thou been guilty?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;None, Francis. Save and except that I
wearied of the court and its vain pleasures.
I would play a man&#8217;s part as did Sir Phillip
Sidney. There was a man, noble, chivalrous
and brave! Ready to adventure all things,
yet he was the flower of courtesy! He was
my example. I wished, like him, to achieve
renown, and so when the news came that
the Armada was about to embark from Spain,
I asked her leave to go with Drake, who was
to set sail for Cadiz to obstruct the Spanish
fleet&#8217;s progress. She refused to let me go, and
so I ran away to Plymouth, where was my
Lord Howard in charge of our ships there
awaiting the coming of the enemy. But the
queen held me in so much favor that she
feared for my safety, and so sent after me, and
had me conveyed hither to remain until the
danger be over. Gramercy!&#8221; he broke forth
his lips curling with scorn, &#8220;am I to stay here
mewed up like a girl when every son of England
should be in arms against the Spaniard?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;But are the Spaniards coming, in truth, Edward?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;So rumor hath it, Francis. &#8217;Twas said
that they have set sail already, but I know
not the truth of the matter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Thou art not much changed,&#8221; said Francis
presently.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;But thou art, Francis. Thou art taller,
and thinner; yea, and paler,&#8221; observed Devereaux
with such a note of compassion in his
voice that Francis flushed. The youth noted
her annoyance and added quickly: &#8220;And
still do you wear the dress of a page? Fie,
Francis! art so enamored of male attire?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay; Master Devereaux,&#8221; replied Francis.
&#8220;I marvel that I tell thee why I do so, seeing
that it concerns thee not, but I wish not to
don my maiden dress until my father bids
me. How long that will be, I trow not, since
I have heard naught of him since I came to
this place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Thy father dwells in France. He with
some others of the conspirators succeeded in
escaping to that country.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;And Lord Shrope? How is he? Fain
would I know, for truly he hath been mine
only friend in this dire time of need.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Lord Shrope hath been in the Netherlands
for nigh two years past, Francis.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Marry, child!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Shelton.
&#8220;Then it could not have been he who sent
thee all those things.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;No; who, who could it have been? Methought
in all England I had no friend but
him. Would that I knew the donor&#8217;s name
that I might cherish it forever.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;&#8217;Twas thine enemy, Francis. Oh, stupid
girl, where are thine eyes! See, his looks
betray him,&#8221; laughed Mrs. Shelton.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Was it thou, Edward Devereaux?&#8221; demanded
Francis.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Well, what if it were thine enemy, Francis?
What then? Wouldst still cherish his
name?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Surely it was not thee, Edward Devereaux?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;It was even I, Francis Stafford.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;But why, why?&#8221; asked she in bewilderment.
&#8220;You are mine enemy and the son of
my father&#8217;s enemy. Why then shouldst thou
show such favor to me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I robbed thee of that deer, Francis. &#8217;Twas
fitting that I should amend the theft if possible.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
A merry twinkle crept into Edward&#8217;s
eye. &#8220;And thou hast still to forgive me the
blow I struck thee in our encounter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I should thank thee, Master Devereaux,&#8221;
said Francis constrainedly. &#8220;I do thank
thee from my heart, though I see no cause yet
for thy action. At another season perchance
I may be able to thank thee in manner more
befitting the courtesy. I thought it from a
friend, and it grieves me that I find it otherwise.
Pray you pardon me that I can do no
more than say, I thank you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;&#8217;Tis enough,&#8221; answered Edward. &#8220;At another
season perchance thou mayst find it in
thy heart to say, &#8217;Ned, I forgive thee the
deer; I forgive thee the blow that thou gavest
me, and I forgive thee that thou art mine
enemy.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;It may be,&#8221; said the girl coldly. &#8220;Come,
good mistress, &#8217;tis time that we did go in.
And so fare you well, Master Devereaux.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Fare you well, mistress,&#8221; answered Devereaux
courteously.

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h3>THE ESCAPE</h3>
</div>

<p>
Frequently after this Francis saw Edward
Devereaux in the garden, but she preserved
such a distant demeanor toward him that the
youth did not dare to address her.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Fie upon thee, lady bird,&#8221; chided Mrs.
Shelton. &#8220;Is it thus that thou dost requite
such favor? Thou dost not deserve to be remembered.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;But I thought that the gifts came from
Lord Shrope,&#8221; said Francis. &#8220;And they are
from mine enemy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;But they served the self-same purpose,
chuck, as if they were in truth from him.
Did they not rouse thee from thy depression?
I tell thee that I have been long in these grim
walls, and I have seen men of high degree forgotten
and forsaken by friends. They have
remained here years without one token from
without. Thou hast been favored to no
small extent, and now thou dost repine and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
will not touch thy guitar because, forsooth,
&#8217;twas sent thee by &#8216;thine enemy.&#8217; Marry!
Pray Heaven send me such enemies!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;It may be that I have been somewhat ungracious,&#8221;
said Francis penitently. &#8220;If thou
wilt permit, good mistress, I will tell the lad
so. But I wish it had been my Lord Shrope.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Out upon thee for such a wish, child!
Marry! to desire to be remembered by an old
man rather than by a young, handsome&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
she laughed and added slyly, &#8220;enemy. Were
he not in the queen&#8217;s favor thou couldst not
have liberty to speak with him, and thou art
foolish to let slip such opportunity for converse.
The queen may repent her of his imprisonment
at any time, and then thou
mayst never see another to hold communion
with.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Am I always to stay here, Mrs. Shelton?&#8221;
asked Francis wistfully. &#8220;Though in truth
were I to be freed I would not know where to
go. Still &#8217;tis hard to be shut up within this
dreary place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I know not, child.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Why have I not been brought to trial?&#8221;
continued the girl, &#8220;Others were tried and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
sentenced and met their doom, while I linger
on, not knowing what my fate is to
be.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I know not,&#8221; answered Mrs. Shelton again.
&#8220;Question it not, girl. There are those here
who have lain for years in like uncertainty,
and will so wait until death releases them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;And their lot will be mine,&#8221; observed the
maiden mournfully. &#8220;Happy were they who
met death on the block! I am so young and
so strong. &#8217;Twill be long ere the tomb claims
me. And to look forward to all those years&mdash;oh,
&#8217;tis hard, hard!&#8221; She paused for a time,
and then went on pathetically: &#8220;I dreamed of
the fens and the wildwood last night, mistress.
Methought the breeze came fresh from
the distant sea. I felt its breath upon my
cheek. I heard the sound of the horns, and
the bay of the hounds as they were unleashed
for the chase. I mounted my palfrey, and
dashed in pursuit of the dogs. I rode as ne&#8217;er
I rode before. On and on! and then, as the
clamor of the hounds told me the game was
brought to bay, I reached for my bow, and&mdash;touched
the walls of my prison. Then I awoke.
It was all a dream,&#8221; she ended with a sob.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
&#8220;All a dream, and I shall never ride in the
forest again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;There, sweetheart! think no more on it,&#8221;
soothed Mrs. Shelton. &#8220;Come! let us go
down to the bonny laddie who, even if he be
thine enemy is more real than dreams.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Francis composed herself and followed the
woman into the garden where Edward Devereaux
already wandered. As she answered his
greeting with a slight smile the youth ventured
to enter into conversation.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Hast heard the report?&#8221; he began eagerly.
&#8220;&#8217;Tis said that the Spanish have been driven
back to their coasts by a storm, but are again
preparing to sail for England. Oh, for a
chance at them! If I could but once take a
Don by the beard I would content me to stay
in these walls forever.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Say not so, Master Devereaux,&#8221; said
Francis. &#8220;&#8217;Tis a dreary place, and hadst thou
been here for nigh two years as I have been thou
wouldst not utter such things. &#8217;Tis dreary&mdash;dreary!&#8221;
She sighed heavily, and despite
herself a tear rolled down her cheek.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;How now, Francis,&#8221; cried Devereaux
touched by her distress. &#8220;Thou with the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
megrims? Why, Francis, &#8217;tis unlike thy
spirit!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I had a dream,&#8221; said Francis striving to
repress her tears, &#8220;and it hath made me long
for liberty.&#8221; And she related it to him.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I wonder not at thy longing,&#8221; said the
lad. &#8220;I too desire with all my heart to be
free. And,&#8221; he lowered his voice and glanced
about for Mrs. Shelton but she was busied over
some plants, and out of earshot, &#8220;and I intend
to be soon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;What!&#8221; cried Francis, her grief forgotten,
looking at him with eagerness.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Not so loud,&#8221; cautioned Edward. &#8220;I
mean to escape, Francis, and to go to Lord
Howard to help fight the Spaniards.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Oh, Edward,&#8221; breathed the girl, &#8220;take me
with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay; I cannot. Thou art but a girl, and
the risk would be too great. I have the freedom
of this inner ward, but there still remains
the outer ward and the moat, which, as thou
knowest, is on all sides of the Tower, and on
the south there is the Thames also. The hazard
would be too great.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay, nay,&#8221; pleaded Francis, her soul on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
fire at the mere mention of escape. &#8220;Do take
me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;But what couldst thou do even were we
to succeed?&#8221; demanded Devereaux. &#8220;Where
couldst thou go?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;To my father in France,&#8221; replied Francis.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay; but&#8221;&mdash;began Devereaux again when
the girl caught his hand and held it tightly
with her own.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I will not let thee go until thou dost consent,&#8221;
she cried with some of her old wilfulness.
&#8220;Oh, Edward, do say yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Devereaux looked at her thin hands, her
face so pale and worn, so different from its
former sauciness, and all the chivalry of his
nature rose up.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;When thou dost speak so, Francis,&#8221; he
said gently, &#8220;I can deny thee nothing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;And thou wilt?&#8221; cried she with shining
eyes.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Yea, Francis; but consider well the
danger. If we fail it may mean death.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;We will not fail,&#8221; declared the girl with
positiveness. &#8220;If we do, is not death better
than imprisonment? I promise that I will
kill at least one Spaniard.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I will hold thee to that vow,&#8221; laughed
Devereaux. &#8220;But thy woman comes, Francis.
I will inform thee of the plan when I
fix on one. Fare you well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Fare you well,&#8221; returned Francis.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Thine enemy&#8217;s converse hath done thee
good,&#8221; commented Mrs. Shelton waggishly on
their return to the upper chamber of the Bell
Tower.
</p>
<p>
Francis looked at her a moment and then
said with dignity:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I had forgot that he was mine enemy,
mistress. Besides, I may have been somewhat
unmannerly in my treatment of Master Devereaux,
and it behooves me as a gentlewoman
to make other recompense for his courtesy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;And say you so, Francis?&#8221; laughed Mrs.
Shelton who considered the affair great sport.
&#8220;Belike it be no unpleasant duty. But there,
child! &#8217;Tis little of entertainment thou hast,
so make merry with the lad for I fear that he
will not remain here long.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I fear so too,&#8221; answered Francis, and in
her heart lay the unspoken wish that not only
Devereaux&#8217;s time but her own might be short.
</p>
<p>
The days passed and Edward Devereaux
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
had not yet matured a scheme for their flight.
June waxed and waned, and July was upon
them. Then one day, when the girl had
almost despaired of hearing him speak of the
attempt again, Devereaux said to her in a low
tone:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Art thou willing to make the effort to-night,
Francis?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;To-night?&#8221; cried Francis thrilling at
the thought. &#8220;Yea; to-night, Edward. But
how?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Does Mrs. Shelton stay in your chamber
at night?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Not now. Not since I recovered from
mine illness.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;And is there not a flight of steps leading
to the roof?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Yes;&#8221; replied Francis surprised. &#8220;How
knew you that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Easily. The alarm bell of the fortress
stands on that roof, and there must of necessity
be communication from the inside as well as
from the outside. Besides all the other
towers are so connected. Thou knowest that
my lodging is the uppermost story of the
Bloody Tower where tradition hath it that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
two princes of York were murdered by Richard
of Gloucester. I have found that between
the outer wall of the Tower and the chamber
there is a passage communicating with the top
of the ballium wall to the west. Along that
I will proceed until I reach the roof of the
Bell Tower where I will make fast the rope for
our descent. After we are down we must
make use of our wits to pass the gate in the
Byward Tower and so reach Tower wharf
where friends will await us with a boat.
There is no moon, and the darkness will favor
the plan. There are secret passages which
lead out of the Tower but these I have been
unable to discover. They are known to but
few and those few are incorruptible. The
passage leading to my lodgings is all that I
have knowledge of, and I had much ado to
find that, and to obtain the rope.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;But the sentinel, Edward? There is
always one stationed by the bell.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Leave him to me, Francis,&#8221; said Devereaux
evasively. &#8220;Do you fear to adventure it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay, Edward. I rather rejoice at the opportunity
for action.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Then await my coming. And to-night
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
the die will be cast. Liberty and England, or
imprisonment and death! All depends upon
this throw. Do you fear, Francis?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;No;&#8221; answered she proudly. &#8220;I am no
weakling that I should fear. Dost thou not
know the motto of the Staffords: À l&#8217;outrance?
(To the utmost) I am a Stafford. Therefore
will I dare to the utmost.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Well said, mistress. If my courage fail
me thou wilt inspire it anew. So fare you
well until night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
They parted, and Francis returned to her
chamber to await the coming of the darkness
with what patience she could. The hours
went by on leaden wings. At last the portal
leading to the roof was opened, and Edward
Devereaux&#8217;s voice sounded in a low whisper:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Francis!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I am here,&#8221; answered the girl thrilled by
the call.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Then come!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Gladly she obeyed, and ascended the short
flight of steps, and soon stood beside the form
of Devereaux on the roof.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;The sentinel,&#8221; she whispered.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Lies there,&#8221; and Devereaux pointed to a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
dark figure extended at full length beside the
belfry. &#8220;Mind him not. We must hasten.
Here is the rope. Descend, and loose not thine
hold of it until thy feet have touched ground
as thou lovest life. Remember the fate of
Griffin of Wales.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Francis grasped the rope and swung herself
clear of the belfry. For a moment she swayed
dizzily, then the rope settled, and steadying
herself by means of the roughened surface of
the old walls she slipped quickly to the
ground. The Bell Tower consisted of only one
story above the ground one so that the feat
was not so difficult as it would have been from
any of the other towers. Giving a tug to the
rope in token that she had reached the ground
in safety she waited Devereaux&#8217;s coming with
palpitating heart. In a few moments he was
beside her.
</p>
<p>
For a second they stood silently, but no
sound from the battlements above betokened
that their flight had been discovered. Grasping
the girl&#8217;s hand Devereaux drew her
quickly across the outer ward into the shadow
of the Byward Tower through which was the
principal entrance. This was guarded by a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
burly warder whom the youth could not hope
to overcome by strength, so he resolved upon
a strategy. With a low breathed injunction
to Francis he bent over, and ran at full tilt
into the man as he came toward them, hitting
him, as he had foreseen, directly in the stomach
and upsetting him. With a roar and a
shout the guard sprang to his feet just as they
darted past him. The drawbridge leading
across the moat was closed, but, nothing
daunted, the two leaped over the railing into
the moat below.
</p>
<p>
The sentinels on the battlements of the
tower heard the splash and instantly gave the
alarm. The bell rang; lights flashed along
the ramparts, and numerous shots were fired
into the moat after the fugitives. The moat
was wide and deep, and Francis whose physical
vigor was undermined by her long confinement,
felt her strength failing.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Leave me, Edward,&#8221; she gasped. &#8220;I can
hold out no longer. Save thyself!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Never!&#8221; came from Devereaux valiantly,
and he supported her with his arm. &#8220;Lean
on me. The wharf is not far distant. Courage!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
</p>
<p>
As they neared the other side a low whistle
sounded, which the lad answered in like manner.
Then indistinctly the form of a man
became visible on the opposite bank.
Again the whistle came, and a line
was thrown out to them. This Edward
grasped, and they were soon towed to shore,
and pulled from the water.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;We must hasten,&#8221; said the man who had
come to their assistance. &#8220;The whole garrison
is aroused.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
With all the speed they could muster they
hurried to the Tower wharf where a boat was
in waiting.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Devereaux,&#8221; said a man grasping the hand
of the youth, &#8220;is it thou?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;In very truth &#8217;tis I, Walter. And right
glad am I to be here. But hasten, beseech
you. I would not be retaken for all the
wealth of Spain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The boat shot out from the wharf into the
river, and passed swiftly down the stream.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<h3>THE THREE VOLUNTEERS</h3>
</div>

<p>
Some distance down the river a vessel lay at
anchor. To this the boat made its way and
lay alongside. Devereaux, the young man
whom he had called Walter, and Francis
scrambled aboard, and the wherry put off.
The sails of the ship were raised, and, as she
glided swiftly toward the open sea, Devereaux
gave a shout of exultation.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Now for Plymouth and the Dons,&#8221; he cried
gaily. &#8220;Oh, Francis, is it not glorious to be
free?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Yes;&#8221; replied Francis, scarce able to speak
so overcome was she by her emotion.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;And as soon as we touch Plymouth thou
canst take passage in another vessel for
France.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Then indeed did the girl turn upon him
with flashing eyes.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;France?&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Go to France while
England is in danger? Never! Never! At
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
Plymouth do I stay, Edward Devereaux, with
the fleet. I am resolved to meet the Dons as
well as thou.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;But, Francis, thy faith! &#8217;Tis the same as
the Spaniards! Thou canst not meet them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;&#8217;Tis true that I am Catholic, but still am
I not born English? Never would I see alien
foot tread English soil, be the intruder of whatever
faith he may.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;And there spake a true Englishman,&#8221; said
he whom Edward had called Walter. &#8220;So
spake Charles Howard, Lord High Admiral
of the navy. And so also hath spoken every
true Englishman of Roman Catholic faith.
Who is thy friend, Edward? I was surprised
to find that another accompanied thee in thy
flight from the Tower.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
As Devereaux opened his lips to reply, Francis
touched his hand warningly and answered
for herself.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I am Francis Stafford. I was imprisoned
in the Tower charged with treason to the queen,
though of that I am innocent.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Well, Master Stafford, prove thy mettle at
this, England&#8217;s time of need, and it may be that
England&#8217;s queen will overlook thy past transgressions.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
I am Walter Mildemay, kinsman
of Edward Devereaux, and a true subject of
the queen&#8217;s majesty, save and except for abetting
the rescue of Edward Devereaux. For
that I hope to make my peace with the queen
if we meet the Spaniards.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Hath their ships been sighted yet, Walter?&#8221;
asked Edward.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay; but they watch for them hourly as
they have been doing for days. &#8217;Twill surely
not be much longer till they come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The summer&#8217;s sun was casting its lengthening
shadows across the quiet harbor of Plymouth
as the little vessel containing the three,
Walter Mildemay, Edward Devereaux, and
Francis Stafford, anchored not far from the
town. A boat put off, bearing the three named
to the place where they had been informed
Admiral Lord Howard was.
</p>
<p>
It was the memorable evening of July 19,
1588, and an exciting game of bowls was being
played upon the green back of the Pelican
Inn known to every officer of Her Majesty&#8217;s
navy. Standing round the bowling alley were
a group of men watching the game with interest.
Lord Howard of Effingham, the Lord
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
High Admiral of England; Sir Robert Southwell,
his son-in-law, the captain of the Elizabeth
Joncas; Sir Walter Raleigh and Sir Richard
Grenville; Martin Frobisher and John
Davis; John Hawkins and his pupil, Sir
Francis Drake, the vice admiral of the fleet.
</p>
<p>
The three paused as they entered this illustrious
group. Sir Walter Raleigh was the
first to spy them.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Ha, my apt pupil of the sword!&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;Why came you hither?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;We are come to join the fleet,&#8221; answered
Francis boldly.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Lord Howard, here be three more volunteers,&#8221;
cried Raleigh. &#8220;Verily it beseems that
all of England&#8217;s sons have come forth for the
fight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;And they have done well,&#8221; answered the
deep voice of the noble admiral.
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto; '>

<p>
So says that knave&mdash;Will Shakespeare. Edward,
thou here again? I thought the queen
held thee in durance?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;She did, my lord admiral,&#8221; returned Devereaux.
&#8220;But think you that I was to be
mewed up like a girl when England had need
of me? I trow not!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Spoken like a true Englishman, boy, save
the slur upon the girl. Know, Master Edward,
that so enthusiastic are women and
girls that if we men wax faint hearted in the
strife English women and English maidens
will take up the battle for their country.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I crave pardon, my lord. Such speech
was unworthy an Englishman when the proof
is by his&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I am Francis Stafford, my lord,&#8221; interrupted
the girl, knowing full well what Edward
was about to say. &#8220;My father and I
were accused of treason to the queen when
Anthony Babington conspired against her life.
I escaped from the Tower in company with
Master Devereaux. Do not, I beseech you,
say me nay when I plead for place with you.
I would fain prove that I am a true and loyal
subject of Her Majesty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;And thou shalt be given the opportunity,
lad. And thou, young sir,&#8221; to Walter Mildemay,
&#8220;art thou escaped from the Tower also?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay, sir; I am but accessory to their
flight,&#8221; replied the young man.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;The saints preserve us!&#8221; ejaculated his
lordship piously. &#8220;Now Heaven send the
Dons soon else I shall have such a storm about
mine ears as never wind did raise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
At this moment an old sailor burst into the
midst of the group.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My lord, my lord!&#8221; cried the weather-beaten
old salt to the lord high admiral,
&#8220;they&#8217;re coming. I saw &#8217;em off the Lizard
last night; they&#8217;re coming full sail, hundreds
of &#8217;em a darkening the waters!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
A cheer rose from the lips of the men; a
spirit of excitement stirred every heart. Nay;
not every breast, for Sir Francis Drake, the
vice admiral, said coolly to his chief as he
hurled the bowl along the smooth, worn
planks:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;There will be time enough to finish the
game, and then we&#8217;ll go out and give the
Dons a thrashing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
And now the beacon lights flashed the
news from hilltop to hilltop, and on to London,
and thence northward to the Scottish
borders, and westward throughout Wales until
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
every village and town of every shire in England
thrilled with the tidings. Forgetful of
religious dissensions, of feud, and of private
wrong, all Englishmen arose as one man to
repel the invading foe.
</p>
<p>
Amidst all the confusion incident to the
announcement of the old seaman, Devereaux
drew Francis aside and whispered entreatingly:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Francis, I implore thee to remain here.
&#8217;Tis not seemly that thou shouldst board ship.
There will be fighting, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;And thou wouldst have all the glory, Edward
Devereaux,&#8221; cried the girl unjust as she
often was when indignant. &#8220;Dost thou
think that I fear? What hath life to yield
that would equal the sweetness of striking
one blow for England? Think you an English
girl cannot fight as well as an English
lad?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay, nay, Francis; but for my sake&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;For thy sake?&#8221; echoed the girl in surprise.
&#8220;Why should I stay for thy sake?
Come! we lose time.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<h3>A BRITOMARTE OF THE ARMADA</h3>
</div>

<p>
The call was sounded. It rang through
every ship like a trumpet note and every man
sprang to his duty.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;On to the Dons! No Spanish Inquisition!&#8221;
was the watch-cry of the English navy,
and with great difficulty, for the wind was
against them, they steered for the open sea.
</p>
<p>
It was not until the next day that they
came within sight of the Armada. The
most powerful fleet that had ever been known
since the beginning of time. Blest by the
pope, sent forth amid the prayers and the
fastings of the people, the fleet had been
cleared of every unclean thing, for haughty
England who styled herself the mistress of the
seas was to be humbled upon her own element
and made to yield her lands to the foreigners.
</p>
<p>
The great Spanish ships, built high like
castles and towers, stretched in the form of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
crescent measuring at least seven miles from
horn to horn. They came slowly on, and, although
under full sail, yet as though the
winds labored and the ocean sighed under
the burden of it, says Camden. When they
reached the open channel Lord Howard discovered
his policy to his men.
</p>
<p>
They were not to come to close quarters
with the towering, unwieldy galleons, but to
pour broadside after broadside into them at a
distance and to bide their opportunity to fall
upon them. Nearer and nearer drew the two
fleets, the Spanish preparing to begin the
action at daybreak. But at two o&#8217;clock the
gibbous moon arose in a clear sky and showed
to the astonished Spanish the English fleet
lying in their rear just out of cannon shot.
</p>
<p>
The next morning Lord Howard, sending
before him a pinnace called the Defiance, provoked
the fight by discharging a piece of her
ordnance and presently out of his own ship,
called the Ark Royal, thundered upon a Spanish
craft which he supposed was that of the
Spanish Admiral, Medina Sidonia, but which
proved to be that of Alphonso de Leon.
</p>
<p>
At the same time Drake, Hawkins and Frobisher
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
fell terribly upon the rear which was
valiantly commanded by Juan Martinez de
Recaldo. The English invaded, retired, and
re-invaded them from every quarter with incredible
celerity. The Spanish captain general
was nonplused. The English ships ran
in, doing as much damage as possible without
coming to close quarters, while his lumbering
craft were useless to chase and cripple so agile
an enemy. The great galleons and <a name="galleasses" id="galleasses"></a><ins class="trnote" title="Transcriber&#8217;s Note: galleases in original text">galleasses</ins>
of Spain towered beside the English ships like
&#8220;Flemish dray horses beside light Arabian
coursers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Fiercer waxed the fight. Recaldo finding
his vessel much battered, rejoined his chief
with difficulty and Medina re-collecting his
scattered vessels held on his course. For two
hours the fight continued, and then Lord
Howard thought best to retire to await the
coming of other ships which had not yet left
the harbor.
</p>
<p>
Flushed and elated with the victory, with
not a single vessel and scarcely a man lost, the
English exulted that the great Armada which
had been devised to strike terror into their
hearts was not so invincible after all.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Is it not glorious, Edward,&#8221; cried Francis
Stafford from a coil of rope upon which she
had thrown herself. &#8220;How the Dons flew!
Oh, &#8217;tis enough to stir a stone to enthusiasm!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;&#8217;Twould be glorious, Francis, were it not
for thee,&#8221; answered the youth. &#8220;The thought
that thou art here hampers my every action,
and always am I looking to see that thou art
safe. Would thou wert in England; even in
the Tower so that thou wert not here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;And wherefore? Do I not bear myself as
becomes an English lad?&#8221; cried Francis. &#8220;In
all the wide world there is no place that I
would rather be than upon the deck of the
Ark Royal. So from henceforth speak no
more of this. And, Edward, drop no hint of
my sex to any. Wherefore should not an
English maiden espouse the cause of her country
as well as an English youth? Thou seest
that there are lads here as maiden like in appearance
as I. Give no thought to me, I beseech
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I will speak of it no more, Francis,&#8221; rejoined
Devereaux. &#8220;And yet I would that
thou wert not here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The girl turned from him impatiently, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
hastily joined a group of which the admiral
was the centre; for Lord Howard had taken
them upon his own vessel.
</p>
<p>
The next night the air was stormy and the
night dark. The English fleet was startled by
an explosion on one of the Spanish ships and
soon the flames were seen to spring high into
the air. But other ships went to her aid and
the fire was soon quenched, but the principal
galleon of Seville commanded by Pedro de
Valdez collided with another vessel and, her
foremast being broken, was forsaken and became
a prey to Sir Francis Drake.
</p>
<p>
Dark as the night was, Lord Howard on the
Ark Royal, accompanied by two ships only&mdash;the
Mary and the Rose&mdash;hotly pursued the
Spaniards. The rest of the English fleet lay
still because Drake had neglected to carry a
lighted lantern in the poop of his vessel as had
been commanded.
</p>
<p>
At break of day, having a prosperous north
wind, the Spaniards bore down upon the
English, but the English, to take advantage
of the wind, turned westward. And then began
a series of maneuvres in which each fleet
contended to deprive each other of the benefit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
of the wind. The contest did not last long
and before noon the English having slipped
between the Armada and the land bore down
upon them right before the wind.
</p>
<p>
And then began a fierce fight which was
waged with varying success. For, while in
one place the English valiantly rescued the
ships of London which were hemmed in by
the Spaniards, in another Recaldo, being in
danger, was disengaged with no less resolution
by the Spaniards. Never before was such
lightning and thunder of artillery heard, most
of which, notwithstanding, went vainly from
the Spanish, flying clear over the English
ships. Only Cock, an Englishman, died gloriously
in the midst of his enemies upon his
own small bark.
</p>
<p>
The English ships being of lesser build than
the Spanish invaded the Spaniards with great
dexterity and having discharged their ordnance
withdrew into the open sea and leveled
all their shot with a certain and successful aim
at the ponderous Spanish vessels.
</p>
<p>
And still the English admiral thought it
not best to grapple and risk the fortune of a
hand-to-hand fight. For the enemy had a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
strong and well appointed army aboard which
he lacked, and, their ships standing higher than
his own vessels, threatened nothing less than
certain destruction to those fighting them
from below. This was the most fierce and
bloody skirmish of all, though it only resulted
in the capture of one huge galleon and a few
small craft by the English. There was a
mutual cessation of hostilities for all the next
day for the wind fell dead and each fleet was
compelled to drift idly with the tide.
</p>
<p>
The calm was still unbroken when the next
day dawned, the twenty-fifth day of the month
sacred to St. James, the patron saint of Spain.
A small galleon of Portugal called the Saint
Anne being unable to keep pace with the rest
of the fleet was set upon by a number of small
English craft, seeing which three of the great
galleasses rowed furiously to her aid. Lord
Howard&#8217;s Ark Royal, the Golden Lion of his
brother, Lord Sheffield&#8217;s Bear, and others
towed by fisher boats met them with such
salvos of shot that, had not the Spanish fleet
come up to rescue them, they would have
shared the fate of Valdez. After this time
the galleasses would not fight again. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
wind sprang up by noon and the fight became
general. All afternoon it raged, and then, terribly
battered, the Armada would fight no
more; but, &#8220;gathering into a roundel&#8221; set
all sail for Calais, where Medina hoped to find
a force from the French to help him and then
to Dunkirk to join with Parma and the great
flotilla of the Netherlands.
</p>
<p>
And so with a full southwest wind the
Spanish fleet went on, the English fleet following
them. It was determined not to attack
them until they reached the straits of
Calais, where Lord Seymour and William
Winter would join the navy.
</p>
<p>
Meantime Lord Howard conferred Knighthood
upon John Hawkins, Martin Frobisher,
Thomas Howard, Lord Sheffield and Roger
Townsend for valor and fortitude. And now
from every bay and harbor of England there
put forth numbers of small craft hired by the
youth of England, who hastened to join
themselves to the fleet, for the Spanish fleet,
though battered and dispirited, was not yet
broken, and should it be joined by the forces
which Medina expected all would indeed go
ill with England.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
</p>
<p>
The Armada anchored in Calais Roads and
within cannon shot of it lay the English fleet.
The next day being the Sabbath both fleets
observed the day with appropriate services,
the loud chants of the Spaniard mingling
strangely with the hymns of the English.
</p>
<p>
Francis Stafford, wearied and fatigued, retired
to the cabin and, finding it deserted,
swung a hammock in one corner and clambering
into it was soon fast asleep.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I tell thee, Drake,&#8221; &#8217;twas the voice of Lord
Howard that awakened her, &#8220;the queen must
have been inspired to invent so ingenious a
device. If it succeeds&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;It will succeed, my lord,&#8221; interrupted
Drake positively, &#8220;That is if there can be
found men who will adventure it. But it
will take cool heads and stout hearts and an
absolute fearlessness of danger. I think I
know two men who will go but there must be
others.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Instantly the girl sat upright in the hammock.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My lord,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;send me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Lord Howard and Sir Francis Drake started
in astonishment.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Boy, I thought thee asleep,&#8221; cried the admiral.
&#8220;How long hast thou been awake?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;But just to hear you say that you needed
men for some service,&#8221; answered Francis,
springing lightly out of the hammock.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I said men, not boys,&#8221; said Drake smiling.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Speak not so, Sir Francis,&#8221; reproved the
admiral. &#8220;The lad hath borne well his part
though he is so slight and maiden-like.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;And there is this to be considered,&#8221; went
on Francis eagerly. &#8220;I have escaped from
the Tower. My father, as ye know, is an
exile. What lies before me but imprisonment,
or that worse than death, exilement
from my native land. &#8217;Twere better to send
me whatever may be the hazard than others
who can illy be spared.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Listen, boy, and thou shalt hear what the
enterprise is. I trow that it will quell even
thy brave spirit, burning though it be with
valor. This night some of our ships covered
over with rosin and pitch and filled with sulphur,
gunpowder and other combustibles, are
to be sent into the midst of the Spanish, fired
and set adrift amongst them. &#8217;Tis fraught
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
with great danger and peril to the lives of
those who adventure it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Still let me be one of them,&#8221; pleaded the
girl earnestly.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;There is much in the lad&#8217;s favor,&#8221; said
Drake meditatively. &#8220;He speaks truth when
he declares that it would be best to send one
who lies under the queen&#8217;s disfavor than another.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Yes; and if successfully performed it may
bring him pardon. Elizabeth cannot but look
with favor upon those who help to carry out
a project devised by herself. Drake, I give
my consent for the lad to go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Perchance Edward Devereaux&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; began
Francis and then paused. What right
had she to bring another into peril that
might result in loss of life? But Lord Howard
laughingly said:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Another youth, Sir Francis, who burns
to distinguish himself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Then let him have his chance,&#8221; was the
vice-admiral&#8217;s reply. &#8220;You and I would have
jumped at such opportunity, my lord.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Go you then, Stafford, to Master Devereaux
and tell him privately of the enterprise.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
&#8217;Twill be naught against him if he chooses
not to accompany the expedition. If he should
so select, come to me, both of you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Francis eagerly sought young Devereaux.
It so chanced that he stood for the moment
apart from his fellows. Joining him she said
in a low tone:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Edward, do you wish to adventure a most
perilous undertaking?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Marry! Francis Stafford! how canst thou
ask such question? Thou knowest that I
burn to do something. It chafes me to be so
inactive while in such near distance lies the
Spaniard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Then hearken! This night ships besmeared
with pitch and rosin and filled with
combustibles are to be sent into the midst of
yon fleet. Two men are already chosen to
guide them thither, and thou and I can accompany
them also. But the admiral bids
me say that it may be dangerous.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Huzzah!&#8221; pealed forth from the lips of
the youth like the blast of a trumpet.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Hush!&#8221; whispered Francis. &#8220;He desires
it not to be made public. Come to him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
She could scarce keep pace with his eagerness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
as he bounded before her into the presence
of the English commanders.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I thank you, my lords,&#8221; he said bowing
to them, &#8220;for this opportunity. When shall
we be off?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The two men could not forbear a smile.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;There is no hurry, Devereaux,&#8221; said Lord
Howard. &#8220;It will be after night falls before
the ships are started. Art sure that the peril
is well understood? It may be that you will
not come back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;It may be so, sir,&#8221; answered the young
man. &#8220;Sir Francis or any one of us
may be taken in the next engagement.
But who would preserve life if by giving it he
may keep England and England&#8217;s queen from
the invader?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Spoken like a true Englishman, lad,&#8221;
cried Drake heartily. &#8220;Now, my lord, these
two will return with me and, in God&#8217;s name,
with my two Devon men we shall this night
so put upon the Spaniards as they shall ne&#8217;er
dream of setting foot on English soil again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Go,&#8221; said the lord admiral placing an
arm about the neck of each. &#8220;Go, my lads.
My hopes and prayers go with you. And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
should aught happen to ye, the queen shall
know that ye died in her service. And so fare
you well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Fare you well,&#8221; answered they both and
followed after Drake to his own boat&mdash;The
Revenge.
</p>
<p>
About two o&#8217;clock Monday morning eight
ships smeared all over the outside with pitch
and rosin, their ordnance loaded with stones
and bullets and filled with sulphur and other
materials suddenly combustible glided out
from among the English fleet and took their
way silently toward the Spanish ships lying
so serenely at anchor. The night was cloudy.
The moon was late in its last quarter and did
not rise till morning. The darkness favored
their enterprise. The wind blew in long, low
gusts from the westward which drove them
full upon the Armada. Presently as the dark
forms of the ships bore full upon the Spanish
vessels a tiny spark of light gleamed like a
twinkling star at the stern of the boats. For
a second it wavered and flickered and then in
a moment more a red glare lighted up the
heavens and cast a lurid glow upon the two
fleets, the cliffs of England and the sea and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
showing plainly two boats&mdash;with Young and
Prowse, the two men of Devon in one;
Francis and Edward in the other.
</p>
<p>
With a rush and roar the flames leaped
madly from stem to stern and up through all
the rigging sending out great tongues of fire
forward, backward, sideways threatening total
destruction to anything that came within
their reach.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Pull, Francis,&#8221; cried Devereaux bending
with desperate strength to the oars. &#8220;Pull
for your life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The girl obeyed with a will. And now
from the ships of Spain there went up a fearful
cry. A panic seized upon them at sight
of those awful burning vessels. They cried
out that not only was there danger of fire but
that they contained deadly engines also.
Everything was in confusion. Panic-stricken
they weighed anchor, cut their cables, hoisted
their sails and struck for the open sea, every
ship afoul of her neighbor. A huge <a name="galleass" id="galleass"></a><ins class="trnote" title="Transcriber&#8217;s Note: gallease in original text">galleass</ins>
had her rudder broken and drifted helplessly
with the tide.

</p>
</div>

<p>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
</p>
<p>
With shouts and cries of joy the English
fleet sailed after the Armada. Meantime the
small boats pulled hastily for the nearest
English vessel, but so suddenly did the
Spanish scatter, and the English change to
take advantage of their flight, that the position
of the boats became dangerous in the extreme:
for what with the high wind, the burning
ships, the rolling of the deep, the helter-skelter
flight of the Armada and the pursuit
of the English their position was, to say the
least, precarious.
</p>
<p>
Devereaux changed the course of his boat
several times, but as he was borne in spite of
himself among the Spanish vessels he cried
despairingly to Francis,
</p>
<p>
&#8220;It is of no avail, Francis. We must die.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Look!&#8221; was the girl&#8217;s reply.
</p>
<p>
Full well upon them bore a galleon, The
Saint Matthew.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Dogs of heretics,&#8221; cried the commander
from the poop of the vessel, &#8220;die!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Ned, dear Ned!&#8221; shrieked Francis, throwing
herself upon him, striving to shield him
from the bullets and arrows that rained about
them. The lad gave her one look, and opened
his lips to reply when, with a shout of wild
joy from the sailors, The Revenge glided in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
between the frail bark and her towering
foe.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Heave ho,&#8221; cried Francis Drake in stentorian
tones. &#8220;Lie to, my lads. Did&#8217;st
think we&#8217;d leave such likely lads to perish?
Nay; below with ye,&#8221; as they were pulled on
deck. &#8220;Ye have done your part. The rest
of us will now bear the brunt of action.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
And the English fleet swept on to deal the
final blow to His Most Catholic Majesty, Philip
of Spain&#8217;s, Invincible Armada.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<h3>PARDON AND HAPPINESS</h3>
</div>

<p>
The final blow which sent the Armada flying
northward had been given. With not a
single ship taken and but one, the small bark
of Cock, lost, and not more than sixty men
killed, the English fleet sent up a pæan of
joy, and drew up for conference before following
further the fleeing enemy.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Ye two,&#8221; said the lord admiral to Francis
and Devereaux, &#8220;seeing that ye lie under
Her Most Sovereign Majesty&#8217;s displeasure,
shall bear to her the tidings of our victory.
None deserve it more, and, please God, by so
doing ye shall win pardon from her. As for
me I shall on after the Spaniard as long as
provisions and ammunition will permit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
And so it came about that Francis and
Devereaux proceeded to the camp at Tilbury,
where the queen was at this time. She was
dining in the tent of Lord Leicester, the lieutenant
general of the land forces, herself being
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
the generalissimo, when they arrived.
There were present, beside the queen and the
earl, Sir Francis Walsingham, who had come
down from London for conference with the
queen; Hatton, the vice chamberlain, the
young Earl of Essex who, despite his inexperience,
had been made the captain-general
of the cavalry, and Lord Shrope, who had
hastened to return to England upon hearing
of his country&#8217;s peril. Francis flashed a
glance of joyful recognition at him, but was
deterred from other greeting by the presence
of the queen.
</p>
<p>
Elizabeth had risen at their approach, and
when the girl beheld her high pale forehead
furrowed by lines of care, the lofty features
sharpened by anxiety, she felt her heart glow
toward her sovereign and the last feeling of
animosity which had lain so long in her heart
faded away never to return. It was therefore
with a sincere feeling of reverence that she
knelt before Elizabeth, who had shown herself
at this time to be a true daughter of the
lion-hearted Plantagenets.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Ye bear messages from the lord admiral,&#8221;
cried the queen somewhat anxiously. &#8220;Rise,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
Edward Devereaux, and deliver thyself of
them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Most gracious madam,&#8221; said Edward, rising
gracefully, &#8220;the strength of the enemy is
broken. Dispirited and distraught they fly
before the lord admiral. Madam, the Armada
is no more. Here are letters writ by
Lord Howard, in which he gives the victory
in detail.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Now God be praised,&#8221; ejaculated the
queen, &#8220;but this is news indeed. My Lord of
Essex, do you spread the tidings throughout
the camp that my loving people may rejoice
with me. Thy indulgence, Master Devereaux,
while I peruse my Lord Howard&#8217;s dispatches.
Retain thy place that I may confer with thee
later.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Rapidly she glanced over the epistles, and
then turned to the assembled lords.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My lords,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;behold these lads!
They have borne themselves with signal valor
during the meeting with the Spaniards.
They two, in company with two others of
whom more anon, set fire to the ships which
brought fear and panic into the fleet of the
enemy. Which same device was recommended
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
by us to the lord admiral. Speak,
Edward Devereaux! What reward dost thou
wish for thy service?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Thy pardon, Most Gracious Lady, for
breaking the bounds in which you placed
me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Ah, Ned, Ned,&#8221; said Elizabeth with that
archness which, despite her fifty-five years, she
continued to employ, &#8220;didst thou not know
that thy queen placed thee there for thy
safety?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;True, madam;&#8221; assented Devereaux.
&#8220;But not the strongest dungeon of the Tower
should have held me in durance when thy
person, and my country were in danger.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Thy silvery tongue no less than thy service
doth well incline me to thy will, Ned,&#8221;
said she graciously. &#8220;Thou art forgiven.
And thou?&#8221; she added turning to the kneeling
girl. &#8220;Art thou not that Francis Stafford
lately concerned in plot against our person?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I am that most unhappy being, madam,&#8221;
said Francis, rising and looking the queen
steadfastly in the face. &#8220;I throw myself
upon your mercy, Your Majesty, and crave
forgiveness. My only plea for so great a fault
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
is, that at that time I had not been brought
near your person and knew you not. Had I
known you I would never have transgressed.
Do with me as you will. Return me to the
Tower, or use your pleasure upon me in any
fashion as seemeth best to you, only forgive
me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Hast thy father schooled thee to speak
thus?&#8221; demanded the queen.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My father? Nay; I know not where he
is. I have not seen him since I entered the
Tower nearly two years ago,&#8221; answered the
girl.
</p>
<p>
The queen said something in a low tone to
Lord Shrope. That nobleman immediately
left the tent, and all eyes centred expectantly
upon the queen. Francis looked at her with
a growing anxiety as she remained silent.
Was she going to remand her to the Tower?
Were not her services deserving of some recognition?
What was meant by that continued
stillness? The queen stood regarding her
with those keen, piercing eyes whose fires age
had not dimmed, and Francis met her gaze
with a sort of fascination, her eyes dilated,
her lips parted as she waited the issue.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
</p>
<p>
Presently Lord Shrope reentered the tent
and with him there came one at sight of
whom Francis gave a great cry.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My father!&#8221; And not even the presence
of the queen could prevent her from running
forward to embrace him. Her father gave no
sign that he knew of her presence, but advancing
to where the queen stood, knelt before
her saying:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;You sent for me, Your Grace, and I am
here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My Lord Stafford,&#8221; said Elizabeth affably,
&#8220;thou knowest that when thou didst present
thyself before us, beseeching us to permit you
to be of service in defending our person, that
we agreed that time should prove thy worth.
My lord, thou and thy son have redeemed
yourselves nobly in our eyes. Rise, my lord!
You are restored to your right of blood and
to your property. Thy son also hath our full
and free forgiveness.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Madam, thou art graciousness itself,&#8221; said
Lord Stafford kissing her hand. &#8220;I do repent
me of all my transgression against you,
but from this time forth, my queen, by the
grace of God, you will have no stauncher
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
subject than William Stafford. As for my
daughter&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Thy daughter?&#8221; cried Elizabeth. &#8220;Thy
daughter? What mean you, Stafford?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;He means, Your Highness,&#8221; cried Lord
Shrope, &#8220;that his son is not a boy, but a girl.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Hold thy tongue, Shrope!&#8221; commanded
the queen sharply. &#8220;Thy wits are addled.
Who is there who will read the riddle clearly?
Thou, Francis Stafford?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
But Francis, utterly miserable in that
her father took no notice of her, was
sobbing bitterly and therefore could not
reply.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Let me read it, Your Majesty,&#8221; said Lord
Stafford, and receiving consent he related the
whole story from the time of her coming to
Stafford Hall, concluding with,
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I know not, Your Highness, why she doth
continue to wear the garb unless from dire
perversity&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay;&#8221; cried Francis, her spirit asserting
itself. &#8220;&#8217;Tis because &#8217;twas at thy bidding that
I donned it, and I vowed never to remove it
until thou didst bid me so to do. Oh, would
that I had perished in battle ere thy hardness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
toward me should pierce me with such agony!&#8221;
And she again gave way to her
grief.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Why, what hath she done, my lord?&#8221;
asked the queen curiously.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;She betrayed my trust, Your Grace,&#8221; answered
Lord Stafford.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Nay, Stafford,&#8221; exclaimed both Walsingham
and Lord Shrope together. &#8220;You wrong
the girl.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Wrong her?&#8221; asked Lord Stafford eagerly.
&#8220;Speak, my lords! If ye can convince me of
that ye shall remove all that my heart holdeth
of bitterness. I long to take her to my
breast again, but I would not so long as I believe
that she betrayed trust.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;She would not betray thee, Stafford, even
when threatened with torture,&#8221; spoke the secretary.
&#8220;My Lord Shrope can bear witness
to the truth of what I speak.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
With a bound Lord Stafford reached the
weeping girl and caught her to him.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My daughter! My daughter!&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;Can you ever forgive me? Say that you
forgive me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;And you do believe in me?&#8221; questioned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span>
Francis clinging to him convulsively. &#8220;Say
that you do, my father.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I do, I do, my child.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My lord, we will permit you to retire until
you are calmer,&#8221; came from the queen.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Thank her, Francis,&#8221; said Lord Stafford
leading the girl forward. &#8220;Thank our gracious
queen who hath shown so much of kindness
to us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;There, sweetheart!&#8221; said Elizabeth as
Francis with streaming eyes tried to articulate
her gratitude. &#8220;&#8217;Twill suffice for the present.
We like thy spirit, and later will receive thee
into service near us. When thou hast donned
thy maiden attire we would see thee again.
Though, by my faith, if all men would honor
the garb as thou hast done, there would be
few knaves in the kingdom.&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>
&#8220;And this is Mistress Francis Stafford?&#8221;
cried Edward Devereaux as, two days later,
Francis stood on the banks of the river watching
the queen as she embarked for London.
&#8220;Upon my word, Francis; thy attire well becomes
thee.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;&#8216;Hast thou found me, oh, mine enemy?&#8217;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span>
quoth the girl gaily turning a bright face toward
him.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Thine enemy, Francis?&#8221; said the youth
reproachfully. &#8220;I thought that that had
passed. After all that we have been through
together thou shouldst not call me so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;And art thou not mine enemy?&#8221; asked
she archly. &#8220;Nay;&#8221; as a pained look crossed
his face, &#8220;I know that thou art not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;And neither art thou mine,&#8221; asserted Edward.
&#8220;Ah, Francis, may not we two bury
that old enmity by a union of our families in
us? If thy father give consent wilt thou
agree also?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;If my father consent, then so will I also,
Edward,&#8221; spoke the girl softly, adding
saucily&mdash;&#8220;&#8217;tis the only way that I&#8217;ll ever get
that deer&#8217;s horns.&#8221;

and great, friendships made and marred, a few heart-burnings,
and many an honest hard-won happiness. The

them, and the one who is going will find herself eager to be
with such as Betty and her friends, and to do as they do.

Marshall</span>. Illustrated by <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Ida Waugh</span>. Two girls, thrown
upon their own resources, are obliged to &#8220;prove up&#8221; their
homestead claim. This would be no very serious matter
were it not for the persecution of an unscrupulous neighbor,

The girls endure many privations, have a number of thrilling
adventures, but finally secure their claim and are generally
well rewarded for their courage and perseverance.

life, form a most interesting narrative of a girl whose
ruggedness and simplicity of character must appeal to the
admiration of all readers.
